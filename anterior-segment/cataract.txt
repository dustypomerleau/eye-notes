if a patient has thin corneas on biometry
    ask about prior KRS

/*
do we routinely measure CCT pre-CEIOL?
    seems like we should
    though proper history will usually yield this data
*/

determining true corneal power and proper IOL power after KRS
    the corneal index of refraction is changed after LASIK OR PRK
    ELP calcs are usually based on corneal power
        post-KRS ELP is more posterior than the calcs would indicate

/*
for exam purposes
    just say
        if I have sufficient data I would use the ASCRS online calculator

                        Latkany historical method

            most people can tolerate 2% easily

            many patients have preoperative aniseikonia if you check for it

                cooling the irrigation fluid may help
            irrigation deflection
                happens right at the start of surgery
                OVD prevents irrigation from reaching the phaco tip
                ALWAYS: run the irrigation for a few seconds before phaco
                    continuous irrigation helps here
            excessive phaco power
        once you note wound burn
            check irrigation line for blockage or disconnection
            if severe
                close and open a new wound
            reduce phaco power

                    attach over wound with 4 cardinal 10–0 nylon sutures
                    then run a 10–0 around the edge to seal

                sliding scleral flap
                    only useful if your incision is off-axis
                        i.e. not useful right @ 12, 3, 9
                        otherwise you risk cutting a rectus muscle insertion
                    5 mm wide strip parallel to the limbus
                    undermine to 1/2 scleral thickness but leave the ends attached
                        helps healing to have the blood supply
                    fold the flap over and suture it upside-down over the wound

                    transconj drainage is possible using a trochar

                if you are planning subsequent PPV
                    drain as much blood as possible before placing trochars

    refractive surprise after CEIOL

                SB
                    ACD is overestimated based on longer AL
                    myopic surprise
            ALSO: Ks wrong due to DES or OSD
            ALWAYS: repeat the biometry
        calcs wrong
            bad formula choice
            mathematical error
        surgeon mistakes
            lens wrong
            lens flipped
                usually myopic
            lens tilted
                usually myopic
            toric lens rotated
                NOTE: toric IOL markers are on the IOL's flat axis
                    toric IOL applies plus 90° away from markers
                    so IOL markers are aligned with patient's steep meridian
                should you rotate the toric surgically?
                    Berdahl and Harden have looked at this
                    http://astigmatismfix.com/
                        compares current position to MRx
                        gives relative benefit of repositioning the toric
                    reported repositioning rates are 1–3%
                    best timing is 1–3 weeks // see Oshika, OPHTHA. 2018;125(1):31–35.
            position wrong
                sulcus using in-the-bag calcs

                less predictable
                more prone to complications
                    fibrosed bag increases risk
                best done in first 8 weeks
                    no absolute cutoff

                        yields 4 mL of epiShugarcaine
                            ~ 2- mL epiShugarcaine/case
                    usage
                        0.1–0.2 mL in place of intracameral lidocaine
                        same volume again under OVD

        if the iris prolapses
            first release the pressure gradient
