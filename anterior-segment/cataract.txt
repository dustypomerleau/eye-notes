if a patient has thin corneas on biometry
  ask about prior KRS

/*
do we routinely measure CCT pre-CEIOL?
  seems like we should
  though proper history will usually yield this data
*/

determining true corneal power and proper IOL power after KRS
  the corneal index of refraction is changed after LASIK OR PRK
  ELP calcs are usually based on corneal power
    post-KRS ELP is more posterior than the calcs would indicate

  post-myopic-KRS correction methods in detail

    if you have access to some pre-KRS data

      clinical history method
          many variations

            Holladay & Hoffer historical method
              variables
                K1/SE1 - pre-refractive-surgery data
                K2/SE2 - post-refractive-surgery data
              K2 = K1 + SE1 - SE2

            Feiz & Mannis historical method
              least likely to give a hyperopic surprise
              variables
                IOL1 - based on pre-refractive-surgery calcs
                IOL2 - correct post-refractive-surgery IOL
              IOL2 = IOL1 - ((SE1-SE2)/0.7)

            Latkany historical method
              requires only the pre-KRS refraction
              IOL1 - flattest K post-KRS fed into SRK/T
              IOL2 - corrected IOL power where
                IOL2 = IOL1 - 0.47(SE1) + 0.85

      Masket method
        LSE - spherical equivalent of the total laser KRS correction
        IOL1 - calculated with 1st gen formulas using post-KRS biometry
          Holladay 1 for AL 23+ mm
          Hoffer Q for AL 23- mm
        IOL2 = IOL1 - 0.326(LSE) + 0.101
      modified Masket (Hill) method
        same formula, different constants
        IOL2 = IOL1 - 0.4385(LSE) + 0.0295

      Walter corneal bypass method
        pre-KRS Ks
        post-KRS AL
        pre-KRS SE is set as the target refraction

      Aramberri double K method
        use the pre-KRS Ks to calculate ELP
        plug this ELP into a standard IOL formula with the post-KRS Ks
          SRK/T
          Holladay
          Hoffer Q

    if you don't have access to any pre-KRS data

      machine-based methods

        BESSt
          Borasio's improvement on the Gaussian optics formula
          requires anterior and posterior K curvature
            Galilei
            Pentacam
            Orbscan
          one of many formulas that use A & P curvature to determine K power
            just mention broadly

        Koch & Wang modified Maloney method
          converts central topography to central keratometry
          K1 = central power
            Zeiss Humphrey Atlas
              value in diopters when cursor is placed at the exact corneal centre
          K2 = 1.114(K1) - 6.1
            plug K2 into your IOL formula

        Koch & Wang topographic central K power adjustment
          variables
            K1 = post-KRS central K power
              Zeiss Humphrey Atlas
                powers of 1, 2, 3, 4 mm topography zones are averaged
              EyeSys Corneal Analysis System
                EffRP (effective refractive power) is used
            ∆D = change in refractive power at the spectacle plane
              usually negative for myopic LASIK
          K2 = K1 + 0.19(∆D)
            plug K2 into your IOL formula

        Haigis-L formula
          built into the Zeiss IOL Master
          generates a corrected corneal power
            regression-derived algorithm
          feeds this into the regular Haigis formula
          ELP is not an issue here
            2nd gen formulas like Haigis don't tie ELP to central K power
            1st gen formulas require the double K method to adjust ELP

      plano CTL overrefraction
        variables
          SE-MRx
            spherical equivalent of the patient's manifest refraction
          SE-CTL-MRx
            spherical equivalent of the patient's plano CTL overrefraction
          CTL-BC-(D)
            base curve of the CTL used for overrefraction (diopters)
        if SE-CTL-MRx is more myopic than SE-MRx
          CTL-BC-(D) is steeper than the patient's average Ks
          true average K = CTL-BC-(D) - |SE-CTL-MRx - SE-MRx|
        if SE-CTL-MRx is more hyperopic than SE-MRx
          CTL-BC-(D) is flatter than the patient's average Ks
          true average K = CTL-BC-(D) + |SE-CTL-MRx - SE-MRx|

IOL formulas
  1st generation
    SRK/T
    Holladay 1
    Hoffer Q
    all 1st generation formulas tie ELP to AL and Ks
  2nd generation
    Haigis
      treats ACD independently of AL
        entire curve shifts based on ACD
      only works well if you personalize your 3 constants
        Warren Hill will do this if you send him a spreadsheet of your outcomes
    Holladay 2
      use requires purchase via the Holladay IOL Consultant software
      actual formula has never been published
      7 variables
      disadvantage
        estimates LT rather than measuring

    Olsen // papers in 2006 and 2009
      Gaussian optics
        thick lens rather than thin lens like other formulas
          uses measured LT
            an advantage over Holladay 2
            uses a C constant
              derived from ACD and LT only
              unique that K readings are not needed to calculate ELP
                big advantage if Ks are atypical
          accounts for both anterior and posterior corneal curvature
        paraxial ray tracing formula improves ELP

biometry factors by importance
  AL
  K
    Galilei for irregular Ks or ectasia // see ectasia-corneal.txt
  WTW
  MRx
  ACD
  LT
  age

biometry platforms
  Lenstar
    more accurate Ks than IOL Master
      32 points measured versus 6
    still need Galilei for ectasia

intraoperative aberrometry

IOL calcs in 26+ mm long eyes
  Warren Hill's interpretation of data from Doug Koch and Li Wang
    // http://www.doctor-hill.com/iol-main/extreme_axial_myopia.htm
    target moderate myopia
    Holladay 1 formula using an optimised optical biometry AL:
      AL = (0.8289 * measured AL) + 4.2663
      no need to adjust the A-constant when using this method
      not for use in prior KRS
        KRS formulas above are already optimised for long eyes

IOL calcs in 22- mm short eyes
  Haigis consistently best
  Hoffer Q also good // most common in AU for RACE purposes

cataract surgery in very short eyes
  nanophthalmos
  microphthalmos
    look for other abnormalities
      colobomas
      cyst
        inferior scleral outpouching
  evaluate distribution of smallness
    small ACD + small AL
      microphthalmos
      nanophthalmos
        AL 20.5- mm
        small cornea
        convex iris
        thick lens relative to the eye
        thickened sclera
          risk of uveal effusion
        thickened choroid
        COMMON:
          FED
          PXF
        preoperatively
          control glaucoma
            topicals
            LPI
          address any preexisting uveal effusion
            2 x inferior sclerectomies
              full thickness
              can be done at the time of CEIOL
    small ACD + normal AL
      relative anterior microphthalmos
        still get ACG like nanophthalmos OR microphthalmos
        sclera is normal
          no uveal effusions
        COMMON:
          FED
          PXF
    normal ACD + short AL
      axial hyperopia
        4/5 hyperopes are in this category
        biometry is the main issue
          // see above for IOL calcs
        intraoperative complication rates are normal
  if lens power falls in the 40+ D range
    expect to place 2 IOLs AKA polypseudophakia
      in the bag
      + sulcus piggyback
        usually Rayner Sulcoflex in AU
    may be better to do a piggyback even when a custom IOL is available
      less spherical aberration with a piggyback
      generally use piggyback for 34+ D
    Holladay IOL Consultant software can make this easier
      Holladay 2 for main IOL
      Holladay R formula for piggyback
/*
for RACE purposes
  given that you have to pay for the Holladay software
  probably best to say you would use Rayner's online piggyback calculator
  you don't want to be asked if you actually own it
*/
  intraoperatively
    topical is better
      retrobulbar blocks increase
        posterior pressure
        vortex vein congestion
    if patient has glaucoma or IOP 25+ mm Hg
      perioperative mannitol
        (2 mL 20% mannitol)/kg
    BSUS available in OT
      for preexisting effusions
      to assess posterior segment after closing the eye
        if you lose the red reflex
    inferior sclerectomies if preexisting uveal effusions
    temporal approach
    clear corneal incisions
      bimanual incisions best in small corneas
    dispersive OVD
      soft shell
    frequent reforming of the AC
      high risk of suprachoroidal hemorrhage with hypotony
    microincision capsulorhexis if possible
      helps keep the chamber deep and stable
      rhexis tend to radialize due to lens shape in nanophthalmos
    if AC is very shallow
      limited 1-port PPV
      PP anatomy is not normal
        retina can run very anteriorly in nanophthalmos
          nearly to the pars plicata
        if there is a PP it's very small
    abort if
      you lose the red reflex
      eye becomes hard
    suture the wound to prevent hypotony

cataract surgery with a trabeculectomy in place
  counselling about risk of trab failure
  wait 6 months after trab before doing the cataract
  5FU 0.1 mL of 50 mg/mL at the time of surgery
  increased postoperative steroids to q 2 h

intraop

  poor dilation
    malyugin ring // or hooks, but mention your preference
      COMMON: 6.25 mm
      ALSO: 7 mm
    intracameral phenylephrine // see more on IFIS below
      0.1 mL of 0.4% Moorfields intracameral phenylephrine

  wound burn
    whitening and gaping of the wound
    bubbling along the length of the phaco tip
    causes
      the incision is too narrow and too long
        crimps the irrigation sleeve
        cooling the irrigation fluid may help
      irrigation deflection
        happens right at the start of surgery
        OVD prevents irrigation from reaching the phaco tip
        ALWAYS: run the irrigation for a few seconds before phaco
          continuous irrigation helps here
      excessive phaco power
    once you note wound burn
      check irrigation line for blockage OR disconnection
      if severe
        close and open a new wound
      reduce phaco power
      if AC is shallowing from wound leak
        elevate the bottle OR increase infusion pressure
      closure
        horizontal mattress suture
          less astigmatism than multiple radial sutures
        scleral patch graft
          best taken ST
          small peritomy
          rectangle of appropriate size
          dissect to 1/2 scleral thickness
          attach over wound with 4 cardinal 10-0 nylon sutures
          then run a 10-0 around the edge to seal
          close the peritomy with interrupteds
        sliding scleral flap
          only useful if your incision is off-axis
            i.e. not useful right @ 12, 3, 9
            otherwise you risk cutting a rectus muscle insertion
          5 mm wide strip parallel to the limbus
          undermine to 1/2 scleral thickness but leave the ends attached
            helps healing to have the blood supply
          fold the flap over and suture it upside-down over the wound

  retrobulbar OR suprachoroidal hemorrhage
    50 g IV mannitol over 15 minutes
      faster than AACG protocol but this is an emergency
    500 mg IV Diamox
    suprachoroidal hemorrhage
      don't drain acutely
        hemorrhage will expand
      serial BSUS
        to look for liquefaction
      drain 1-2 weeks
        AC maintainer
          25 g PPV infusion through the limbus can be used
        radial sclerotomies 4+ mm from the limbus in the affected quad
          transconj drainage is possible using a trochar
            about 7 mm back
            danger of trauma to choroid and retina
              watch your angle
        cyclodialysis spatula to open the wound if needed
        if you are planning subsequent PPV
          drain as much blood as possible before placing trochars
          anatomy is dramatically distorted with high choroidals

  refractive surprise after CEIOL
    biometry wrong
      COMMON:
        prior KRS
        SB
          ACD is overestimated based on longer AL
          myopic surprise
      ALSO: Ks wrong due to DES OR OSD
      ALWAYS: repeat the biometry
    calcs wrong
      bad formula choice
      mathematical error
    surgeon mistakes
      lens wrong
      lens flipped
        usually myopic
      lens tilted
        usually myopic
      toric lens rotated
      position wrong
        sulcus using in-the-bag calcs
    postop complications
      CME
        usually hyperopic
      corneal change from incision
      capsular distention
        retained OVD
        usually myopic
    management
      in general
        measure postop Ks before acting
        consider corneal causes of astigmatism
        don't just leap to a toric exchange or piggyback
      glasses
        assumes patient tolerance
        aniseikonia limits anisometropia to 3 D
      contact lens
        assumes patient tolerance
        reduces aniseikonia
      KRS AKA bioptic surgery
        limited by stromal bed if patient has had prior KRS
      piggyback IOL
        available in toric and multifocal
        sulcus placement over an in-the-bag lens
        predictable because it leaves other factors constant
        easily removed if patient unhappy
        adverse events
          interIOL opacification
          optic capture
          pupillary block glaucoma
          pigment dispersion
      IOL exchange
        less predictable
        more prone to complications
          fibrosed bag increases risk
        best done in first 8 weeks
          no absolute cutoff
        good for patients that lack posterior chamber depth for a piggyback
      LRI
        supplements above
        less popular than before
        alternative to KRS or toric
