current method for sutured IOL:

GoreTex CV-8 (7–0 equivalent)
  46 cm length
  TTc-7 is the smallest needle
    but you will cut it off anyway

apply OVD to the cornea
  refresh as needed
360 peritomy
hemostasis superiorly
3 port PPV setup
  place your ports carefully
    infusion
      low enough to avoid suture holes
      high enough to allow torting eye downward for the frownie incision
    other trochars
      high enough to avoid suture holes
        COMMON: use upper trochar as upper suture hole
        ALSO: rotate so nasally trochar is lower suture hole
          // assumes a small superior incision
          // may not be compatible with frownie
      low enough to avoid superior frownie incision
complete PPV
  ensure PVD
  remove any capsular remnant
  shave vitreous base
frownie incision @ 12
  2 mm from the limbus at the apex
  width appropriate for lens
    B & L Akreos AO60 (hydrophilic acrylic)
      4.5 mm
    Alcon CZ70BD (PMMA)
      external 6 mm
      internal 7.5 mm
  stay intracorneal for now
create suture holes
  5 mm apart
    makes suture rotation easier
    avoids compression of Akreos haptics
  equal position
    2 straddling 0300
    2 straddling 0900
  OR to make maneuvering around the nose easier
    use trochar position as
      superior suture hole temporally
      inferior suture hole nasally
    effectively rotating axis of sutures so nasal is high and temporal is low
    // assumes a small superior incision
    // may not be compatible with frownie
  3 mm from the limbus
    2–3 mm have been described
    sulcus is probably 2.5
  enter parallel to iris plane
  use 15˚ blade
    internal os is much smaller than an MVR incision
    allows rotation of knot but usually does not need suturing
open suture
  cut off needles
  cut in half
open lens
  transfer to the operating field
thread sutures through haptics
  CZ70BD
    run both sides of suture in front of the haptic
  Akreos
    run both sides of suture front to back
enter AC using a 3 mm keratome blade
  widen incision as above
pass sutures
  1 at a time
  into the AC with a tying forcep
  retrieve via your suture holes with a VR forcep
  COMMON: inferior suture before superior suture on each side
  ALSO:
    both nasal sutures
    pass IOL
    both temporal sutures
    this may help avoid suture tangle
take the slack out of the sutures
pass the IOL into the AC
  CZ70BD
    simply pass with a tying forcep and hold the wound with a toothed forcep
  Akreos
    hold along the long axis with a tying forcep
    fold along the long axis with a folding forcep
      0300 and 0900 sutures stay on their respective sides
        rather than touching each other
    grasp with delivery forcep to deliver to the AC
take the slack out of the sutures
slide the suture a bit on each side
  to ensure that the suture moves freely and is not bound around the haptic
  so you know you can bury the knot later
tie each side
  Akreos is not that long
    use slipknots
      OR just leave your 3 without completing 3–1-1
    center before tying off
tuck the knot into the sclera with a tying forcep
  COMMON: use the side that held the trochar
    usually more dilated
  ALSO: use the side created with 15˚ blade
    you can control how dilated this is when you make it
trim the ends flush with the sclera
suture the frownie incision with interrupted 10–0 nylon
close the conjunctiva with 6–0 plain gut
  take episcleral bites at the limbus
