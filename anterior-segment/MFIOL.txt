MFIOL

contraindications
  reacts badly to counseling
    glare
    halos
    glasses
    need for additional surgery
      KRS
      piggyback
      exchange
  unrealistic patient expectations
    picky
    type A
    OCD personality
  happy to wear glasses
  primary concern is sharp, clear vision
  heavy dependence on intermediate vision
    computer occupation
  heavy dependence on night vision
    pilot
    taxi driver
    truck driver
  low myopes
    accustomed to perfect uncorrected reading vision
  cylinder 0.75+ D
    toric MFIOL if otherwise a good candidate
  poor candidate for bioptic KRS
    corneal topography
    OSD
    prior PK
    ... // see KRS.txt
  lots of higher order aberrations
    especially
      3rd and 4th order
      coma is a particularly bad 3rd order
  inaccurate biometry
    for any reason
  ectasia
    keratoconus
    pellucid
  FED
  pupil size
    too big
    don't constrict enough at near
    too dilated when reading in dim light
      4 mm is ideal
    more glare and halos
  PXF
  optic nerve dysfunction
  poor macular function
    ERM
    AMD
    chronic DME
    ...
  dementia
  alternating monofixators
    such as large angle XT
    mild amblyopia can be revealed after MFIOL
      acuity gets worse when you reduce contrast
  intraop
    decentered rhexis
    decentered bag
      zonular loss
    PC tear
      not an absolute contraindication
      can sometimes be saved with a posterior rhexis

when consenting for MFIOL
  use the word 'tradeoff'
    it is received better by patients than 'compromise' or 'sacrafice'

multifocal IOL options // AU
  ReSTOR diffractive ± toric (Alcon)
  Tecnis diffractive ± toric (AMO)
  AT LISA trifocal diffractive ± toric (Zeiss)
    plate haptic
    stable
    hard to remove or rotate
  M-flex refractive ± toric (Rayner)

toric IOL options // AU
  AcrySof toric (Alcon)
    ~ 1–4 D at the corneal plane
  Tecnis toric (AMO)
  AT TORBI bitoric (Zeiss)
    same plate haptic as the AT LISA
  T-flex toric (Rayner)

full arsenal
  monofocal distance ± toric
  monofocal near or intermediate ± toric
  bifocal diffractive ± toric
  bifocal refractive ± toric
  trifocal diffractive ± toric
  LRI
    nomogram
      DONO
      NAPA
      both go up to 3 D
      in practice don't try to correct 1.5+ D astigmatism with LRI
        2 x 60° (2 CH) incisions
    online calculator from AMO
      takes cataract wound into account
      http://www.lricalculator.com/
    blade depth == 90% of thinnest pachymetry
  keratorefractive surgery
  contact lenses distance
  monofocal glasses distance
  monofocal glasses near
    exact distance depending on patient needs

  most not using LRI or KRS to routinely correct astigmatism
    OK for late tweaking if toric inadequate or rotated

unhappy patient after MFIOL
  residual refractive error
    refraction
      look for astigmatism in particular
      if refraction corrects them
        trial frame in the office
      if refraction can't correct them
        repeat corneal topography
          irregular astigmatism is a common culprit
      options
        observation
        glasses
        KRS
        IOL exchange
  glare and halos
    immediate
      watch
    delayed
      revisit refraction and topography
        options above
      look for PCO
      YAG if indicated
  poor contrast sensitivity
    check for concurrent disease
      macular pathology
        postop CME
      optic nerve pathology
        including glaucoma
  counsel and be patient

reducing unhappy toric patients
  gradual lifetime shift is against-the-rule
    a minority of surgeons intentionally leave a touch of with-the-rule
  corneal topography
    make sure the head is straight in the machine
    10° tilt loses 1/3 of the toric's effect
    posterior corneal astigmatism
      probably the cause of most "lenticular astigmatism"
      usually steep in the vertical meridian
        unlike anterior astigmatism
          remains steep @ 90 with age
          steeper posterior curvature adds minus cylinder
            reduces WTR
            adds ATR
        so to review
          both the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces start steep @ 90 WTR
          the anterior surface gradually shifts against the rule as we age
          the posterior surface stays the same
      use Galilei OR Pentacam to get good posterior readings
      allows more accurate calculation of total corneal astigmatism
  limbal marking
    Osher ThermoDot allows small marks that don't diffuse like ink
  using the iris
    note landmarks in the axis of interest
  limbal registration systems
    Alcon Verion
    Zeiss Cataract Suite
    TrueVision TrueGuide
  intraoperative wavefront aberrometry
    useful during CEIOL even for spherical IOLs
      Alcon WaveTec ORA with VerifEye
        Alcon is expected to combine Verion + ORA into one product soon
      Clarity Medical Systems Holos IntrOp
  postop analysis of lens position
    NIDEK OPD-Scan
      combines
        keratometry
        corneal topography
        autorefractor
        wavefront aberrometry
      can analyze the toric position in place and give residual astigmatism
    ASCRS online calculator
      http://www.ascrs.org/toric-results-analyzer
      input
        MRx
        toric model
        current axis of toric
      outputs estimated effect of rotating IOL on the MRx
      same site as Barrett toric calculator and post-KRS IOL calculator
  secondary surgery
    lens adjustment
      3–8 weeks
      MRx usually stable by 4 weeks but IOL still mobile
