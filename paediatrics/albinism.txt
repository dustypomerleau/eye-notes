albinism

  ask about
    bleeding
    bruising
    recurrent infections
    developmental milestones

  all albinism
    decreased VA
      COMMON: foveal hypoplasia
      ALSO: ON hypoplasia
    nystagmus
      COMMON: PAN
    reduced stereopsis
      over-decussation at the chiasm
      confirmed by asymmetric VEP
    iris TI defects
    fundus hypopigmentation
    foveal hypoplasia
      ± ON hypoplasia

  AR OCA "he's A ROCkAh"
    7 types primarily based on mutation
    spectrum of tyrosinase activity
    the term "tyrosinase negative" has been abandoned in favour of a continuum
      generally
        more tyrosinase activity (previously tyrosinase positive)
          better VA
            6/36+ requires some tyrosinase activity

  XLR OA
    XLR therefore predominantly boys
    OA1 is the usual variant
      mud splattered fundus in carrier females
    OA2 overlaps clinically with some forms of CSNB


  syndromes

    Hermansky-Pudlak
      AR OCA
      bleeding problems from low platelets
      lung disease
      colitis
      Swiss or Puerto Ricans
        H[PPP] [Pudlak Platelets Puerto Ricans]

    Chediak-Higashi
      AR OCA
      severe pyogenic infections
      mucosal inflammation and ulceration
      coagulation problems
      neurologic decline
      early death
      blood smear to diagnose
      most common of the silvery hair syndromes with Griscelli and Elejalde

    albinoidism
      hypopigmentation
      normal vision
      normal fovea

    AD Waardenburg syndrome
      patchy piebald skin and hair
      heterochromic irides
      sometimes deafness


  management
    examine parents and siblings
    skin biopsy
      to prove carrier state
        macromelanosomes are present in carriers
      to determine if there is any tyrosinase activity
        presence of microscopic melanin is helpful
        melanocytes can be cultured and tested for tyrosinase expression
    systemic workup for HP & CH
    aggressive sun protection
      sunglasses
      sunscreen
      hats and full clothing
      will need to work indoors as an adult
    address
      refractive error
      strabismus
      amblyopia
    ALWAYS: refer to a geneticist
    ALWAYS: refer for low vision rehabilitation
      Royal Society for the Blind
      low vision clinic referral
      optimize the home environment for low vision safety
      low vision schooling
        usually for those with complete absence of tyrosinase activity
