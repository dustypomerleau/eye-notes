  NF1
    1/2 AD
    1/2 sporadic
    melanocytic lesions
      skin
        cafe au lait spots
      uveal tract
        Lisch nodules
          commonly visible at 5+ YO
          a few patients don't get them until their teens
        choroidal nodules
    glial cell lesions
      skin
        nodular neurofibromas
        plexiform neurofibromas
          can cause amblyopia
          difficult to remove
          can be debulked
            ± frontalis sling
          increases risk of glaucoma on the affected side
      CNS
        optic nerve gliomas
        chiasmal gliomas
          try to watch them
            if significant proptosis OR
            elevated ICP
              debulking
              ± chemo and radiation
    glaucoma
      especially in eyes with plexiform neurofibromas
    increased risk of secondary tumors
      JXG
      retinal capillary hemangioma
      rhabdomyosarcoma
      pheochromocytoma
      Wilms tumor
      leukemia
    NF1 diagnostic criteria
      2+ features
        1st degree FH
        6+ cafe au lait spots
        2+ axillary or inguinal freckles
        2+ cutaneous neurofibromas
        1+ plexiform neurofibroma
        2+ lisch nodules
        optic pathway glioma
        osseous dysplasia
          COMMON: sphenoid dysplasia
    NOTE: MRI is not necessary at baseline with good VA and a normal nerve

  NF2
    RARE
    1/2 AD
    1/2 sporadic
    neurofibromas
    acoustic neuromas
    meningioma
    schwannoma
    PSC cataracts

  sporadic tuberous sclerosis
    cognitive impairment
    seizures
    facial angiofibromas
    retinal hamartomas
      COMMON: inner-retinal glial tumors AKA astrocytic hamartoma

  AD VHL
    retinal and CNS capillary hemangioblastomas
      ALWAYS: MRI
      treatment
        observation
        for small lesions
          laser
        cryo
        ± antiVEGF
    renal carcinoma
    pheochromocytoma

  sporadic Sturge-Weber syndrome AKA encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis
    CNS calcification
      ALWAYS: MRI
    seizures
    focal neurologic deficits
    facial port-wine stain
    glaucoma
      same side as the PWS
      bimodal presentation
        congenital
        later in life
      hard to control with medication
      frequently requires trab
    diffuse choroidal hemangioma

  AR ataxia telangiectasia AKA Louis-Barr syndrome
    CNS motor dysfunction
    poor saccades with head thrusting
    conjunctival telangiectasias

  XLD incontinentia pigmenti
    only in girls (boys die)
    bullous skin lesions
    hydrocephalus
    seizures
    ischemic peripheral retina

      NVG
    ROP-style laser management

  sporadic Wyburn-Mason syndrome
    CNS AV malformations
      ALWAYS: MRI

      watch them unless they bleed or cause glaucoma
