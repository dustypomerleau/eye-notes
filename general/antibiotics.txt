antibiotic susceptibilities // ideally you would know these for your region

    cephalosporins
        1st generation
            Staphand Strep but no MRSA
            minimal gram-negative coverage
            cephalexin
            cefazolin
        2nd generation
            terrible for gram-positives
            better gram-negative coverage than 1st generation
            cefaclor
            cefuroxime
            cefotetan
        3rd generation
            moderate gram-positive coverage but not great
            good gram-negative coverage
            good CNS penetration
            ceftriaxone
                not good for Pseudomonas
            ceftazidime
                good for Pseudomonas
        4th generation
            as good as 1st generation for gram-positives
            excellent gram-negative coverage
                including Pseudomonas
            good CNS penetration
            cefepime

    fluoroquinolones
        2nd generation
            moderate gram-positive coverage
                covers SA but not pneumococcus
            good gram-negative coverage
                including Pseudomonas
            ciprofloxacin
            ofloxacin
        3rd generation
            better gram-positive coverage than 2nd generation
                including pneumococcus
            better atypical coverage than 2nd generation
            nearly as good gram-negative coverage as 2nd generation
            levofloxacin
        4th generation
            better gram-positive coverage than 3rd generation
                for MRSA you still need vancomycin
            similar gram-negative coverage to 3rd generation
            broad anaerobic coverage
            good coverage of atypical mycobacteria
                common in post-LASIK infections
                    M. fortuitum
                    M. chelonae
            moxifloxacin
            gatifloxacin
