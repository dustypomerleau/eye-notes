hyphema
  in at risk groups
    ALWAYS:
      screen for sickle cell
        molecular genetic methods now standard
        black
        mediterranean
        Saudi Arabia
        India
        Central and South America
      ask about FH sickle cell or other hemoglobinopathy
      no Diamox or topical CAI if you can avoid it
        CAI will increase sickling if pt has sickle cell
      cycloplegia may reduce rebleed in sickle cell
  AC washout in hyphema
    in sickle cell
      IOP 25+ x 1 day despite MMT
    in non-sickle cell
      IOP 25+ + total hyphema x 5 days
        to prevent corneal blood staining
      IOP 50+ x 2 days
        to prevent optic atrophy
      clinical signs of blood staining
        regardless of IOP OR duration
        mechanism of corneal blood staining
          hemoglobin from the AC is forced into the corneal stroma
          keratocytes phagocytose hemoglobin and store hemosiderin
          keratocytes die and release hemosiderin
          hemosiderin diffuses easily
            can stain all the way to the epithelium
    technique
      GA
      avoid
        hypotony OR
        flat AC
          to prevent rebleeding intraoperatively
      if they do bleed
        OVD OR air tamponade
      2 paracenteses
        BSS irrigation through 1
        depress lip so blood exits through 2
      for thick blood
        Simcoe cannula
        bimanual I/A
        25 g PPV handpiece
      for fibrinous hyphemas
        adjunctive tPA
      you don't need to clear 100% of the blood
        being aggressive risks a rebleed or damage to the iris
      suture all wounds
    first 5 days are the most critical period for a rebleed

elevated IOP in the wake of trauma DDx
  angle recession
  lens-associated uveitis
  secondary angle closure
    PS with pupillary block
    subluxed lens
      zonular dialysis
      phacodonesis
      lens tilt
      IOP improves when supine
      UBM helpful to show lens malposition
      treatment
        dilation may help temporize
        urgent CEIOL
          may require
            PPV
            sutured IOL
            ACIOL
  aqueous misdirection
  PACG
    may have a phacomorphic component
    more common in
      short eye
      FH

NAI
  subdural hemorrhages
    bridging veins tear during shaking
  diffuse retinal hemorrhages
    too many to count
      extent of hemorrhages is important
        if they are extensive
          document this
        less extensive hemorrhages are nonspecific
    multilayered
      preretinal
      intraretinal
      subretinal
    extending to the ora
    hemorrhagic macular retinoschisis
      highly specific for NAI
    hemorrhages can be unilateral
    etiology of retinal hemorrhages
      probably VR traction
  perimacular folds
  disc swelling
    PP NFL hemorrhages
  encephalopathy
  skeletal survey
    occult fractures
    multiple stages of healing
  mild cases
    vomiting
    lethargy
  document
    caregivers
    social history
    prior admissions
    siblings
    complete eye and physical exam
    report to authorities
    Retcam photos if available

if there is blunt trauma to the eye
  pursue the workup for orbital fractures and intracranial injury
  // see fractures-orbital.txt

diplopia after trauma
  orbital fractures
    CT and exam will rule this out
  CN[346]P // see strabismus notes
    face turn
    head tilt
    chin down
      bilateral CN4P
    for CN3P
      ptosis
      pupil changes
  breakdown of preexisting phoria OR previously weak fusion
    COMMON: after head trauma
    usually improves
  monocular diplopia due to eye injury

thermal burns
  eyelid skin is thin
    burns will be relatively deeper than classified elsewhere on the body
  severity
    epidermal AKA 1st degree
    partial-thickness AKA 2nd degree
      includes some dermis
      usually heals without scarring
    full-thickness AKA 3rd degree
      all of the dermis
      heals with scarring
    deep burns AKA 4th degree
      underlying soft tissue is destroyed
  exam
    ALWAYS: check burn victims for a CTL or other FB
    periorbital edema
    lids
      depth of burns to eyelid skin // see severity above
      lash burn or loss
      lid lag
      loss of eyelid tissue
        particularly WRT corneal exposure
      canalicular involvement
      cicatrical ectropion
        assess during healing
    protective reflexes
      corneal sensation
      Bell phenomenon
    conjunctiva
      limbal ischemia
        a white eye should worry you
      chemosis
      necrosis
      symblepharon
        assess during healing
    cornea
      PEE
      exposure keratopathy
      epi defect
      limbitis
      limbal ischemia // as above
      LSCD
        assess during healing
      corneal opacification
      stromal melting
      perforation
    lens
      cataract in severe burns
  treatment
    IV fluid resuscitation and oral pain meds
      would usually be handled by the 1° team
    remove or trim scorched eyelashes
      they tend to fall into the eye along with char from the skin
    leave blisters intact
      but debride dead tissue and eschar
    paraffin emollients to burns on the skin
    nonadherent dressings
    major issue is exposure OSD as eyelid burns heal and contract
      patient may look fine on admission and gradually get worse
    BROADLY: PF medications when possible
    aggressive lubrication
      Cellufresh 1–4 hourly
    Chlorsig prophylaxis qid
      the risk of 2° infection is high
    topical steroids should be used with caution
      sometimes very helpful with severe edema
    reduce melting
      doxycycline 100 mg po daily
      ascorbic acid 1 g po bd
    full-thickness skin grafts
    amniotic membrane grafts
    tarsorrhaphy
      temporary OR permanent
