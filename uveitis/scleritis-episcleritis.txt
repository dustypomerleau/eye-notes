  treatment
    ladder
      ibuprofen 600 mg po tds
        NSAIDs are usually not effective in scleritis
        OK to try them in mild cases
      prednisone 1 mg/kg/d po
      SSIMT
        methotrexate
          good in RA
        cyclophosphamide OR
        mycophenolate
          good in vasculitis
        TNF inhibitors
    OK to add topical PF but the main treatment is systemic
    infectious scleritis treatment
      both systemic and topical
      agent is variable depending on the culture
        Pseudomonas
          ceftazidime
        Nocardia
          gram positive but often resistant
          amikacin is a good first choice
        fungal
          natamycin is an acceptable empiric fungal therapy
      severe cases
        may need surgical debridement at the time of culture
