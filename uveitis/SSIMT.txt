steroid-sparing immunomodulatory therapy

before starting SSIMT
                ALWAYS:
                    perform a pregnancy test
                    counsel the patient about
                        need for birth control
                        birth defects
                            methotrexate
                            mycophenolate
                        subsequent fertility issues
                            alkylating agents like cyclophosphamide probably reduce fertility
                                fortunately we don't use them much for uveitis
            start SSIMT
                if they have a known systemic disease causing their uveitis
                good control but very high IOP
                unable to taper systemic steroids
                systemic steroid side effects
            once you start SSIMT
                expect to keep them on it for at least 24 months
            methotrexate
                mechanism
                    folate analog antimetabolite
                dose
                    adults
                        15–25 mg po/week
                    kids
                        0.5–0.8 mg po/kg/week
                    + folic acid 1 mg po daily
                        usually given as 5 mg po q week in a single dose
                        give folic acid the day after methotrexate
                            same-day administration reduces the effect of methotrexate
                        some docs only give folic acid for patients with side effects
                            nausea
                            vomiting
                            abdominal pain
                            abnormal LFTs
                            mouth sores or ulcers
                    dose can also be calculated in terms of BSA
                        COMMON: when dosing children
                        BSA formula
                            easiest is Mosteller
                                BSA = sqrt(height (cm) x weight (kg)/3600)
                        for uveitis
                            10–20 mg/m2
                                20–40 mg/m2 is possible but atypical
                    oral absorption is not as good as parenteral
                        oral absorption is ~ 30%
                        parenteral absorption is nearly 100%

                        the difference is most important at 15+ mg/week

                    Qgold
                        TB is not an absolute contraindication to TNFI
                        full TB treatment first
                        then very close monitoring
                    in intermediate uveitis
                        ALWAYS: MRI to assess for MS
                        TNFI will worsen demyelinating disease

                100% incidence of cataract after 5 IVT
            100% recurrence of CME with regional alone
                so nearly always use systemic
        systemic

Jabs prednis(ol)one regimen
    1 mg/kg/d 60- mg max
        60+ mg greatly increases the risk of ischemic necrosis of bone
    taper after 2–4 weeks
        if you can't taper
            SSIMT
    goal
        SUN 0
        under 7.5 mg/kg/d
    Jabs does not use prophylactic PPI
        NSAIDs cause PUD
            steroids potentiate NSAID-associated ulceration
            steroids alone have low risk of PUD
        PPI increases the risk of osteoporosis
    calcium + vitamin D is an optional adjunct
        per Jabs
            calcium alone may increase the risk of MI
        most sources I read say MI risk is slightly increased ± vitamin D
    weigh your patients
        Hawthorne effect
            measured behavior is modified behavior
    taper
        60–40 -10 mg/(week OR 2 days if rapid)
        40–20 -5 mg
        20–10 -2.5 mg
        10- -2.5–1 mg

monitoring SSIMT
    bloods 4–6 weeks

start SSIMT at diagnosis
        COMMON:
            JIA
            MC ± P
            BSCR
            VKH

choice of agent
    mycophenolate OR methotrexate
    efficacy
        mycophenolate > methotrexate
        cyclosporine has poor efficacy
    tolerance
        mycophenolate > azathioprine
        cyclosporine is poorly tolerated

mycophenolate
    mycophenolate mofetil AKA Cellcept
        2–3 g daily
            divided bd
        diarrhea
            less if you ramp up slowly
        in children // see Doycheva, BJO 2016
            225 mg/m2 bd x 1 week
            then 450 mg/m2 bd
            ± prednisolone 1 mg/kg/d
                taper
                    10 mg/week to 30 mg/d
                    5 mg/week to 20 mg/d
                    2.5 mg/week to 0 mg/d
    enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium AKA Myfortic
        reduces GI side effects
        dose conversion
            360 mg mycophenolate sodium = 500 mg mycophenolate mofetil

cyclosporine
    avoid in psoriasis
        these patients are often on PUVA OR topical cyclosporine
        po cyclosporine potentiates PUVA and topical cyclosporine skin cancer risks

alkylating agents
    cyclophosphamide
    chlorambucil
    avoid in the young
        especially for duration 2+ years
    high risk of cancer
        COMMON: nonmelanotic skin cancer
        all agents have some risk but this class is the worst

TNFI
    use first line for Behcet
    COMMON: in combination
        methotrexate
        mycophenolate
    if using TNFI in intermediate uveitis
        ALWAYS: MRI
            TNFI make MS worse
    hard to taper
        Foster BSCR data indicates they may need treatment for life
    increased nonmelanotic skin cancer

once SSIMT initiated
    treat 3+ y regardless of activity
    treat 2+ y inactive
    data is from a study in JIA

if SSIMT is inadequate but not ineffective
    add a 2nd agent
    you may be able to lower the dose of 1 or both once controlled
