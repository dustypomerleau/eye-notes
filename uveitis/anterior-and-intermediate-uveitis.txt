                older B27+ boys
              B27+ boys > 6 YO are now excluded from the JIA classification

          cataract
            often a presenting complaint
          glaucoma
            patients have wide IOP fluctuations
            follow them for glaucoma even if the IOP seems normal
            get baseline glaucoma studies
            very hard to treat when it occurs
          anterior vitritis and vitreous opacities
          absence of CME despite inflammation
        treatment
          topical steroids are notoriously ineffective
            sometimes trying and failing helps you make the diagnosis, however
          most patients don't need treatment
          for patients with severe floaters
            OFT for vitritis is an option

              even though they aren't common preop
            IOP spikes
              watch them carefully for postop elevation
              once the pressure spikes it tends to resist treatment
            perioperative steroids are OK
              preop topical is probably enough
              some surgeons use oral also
              increase your postop steroids
            acrylic IOLs are the least inflammatory
          ALWAYS: address glaucoma even if the presenting IOP is normal
            poor response to MMT
            NEVER: SLT
              too much inflammation
              underlying cause is a trabeculitis

treatment

  when treating endophthalmitis
    mention systemic steroids
      1 mg/kg po prednisolone is expected in AU

  approach to noninfectious uveitis
    steroids
      topical steroids
        PF hourly
        taper at 5- WBC/HPF
          start at qid
          hold at each level for the time it took to reach 5- WBC/HPF on hourly
            longer time to initial control means slower taper
          if you use oral or injectable steroid to gain initial control
            taper 1 drop every 4 weeks
      oral steroids
        if oral prednisolone is required for initial control
          periocular triamcinolone may allow faster taper of systemic steroids
            OFT 40 mg in 1 mL
              plan on IOP elevation and cataract if used repeatedly
              if inadequate but IOP OK
                try IVT
        in pregnancy
          prednisolone probably safe
          triamcinolone unclear
            probably OK as a local injection
          dexamethasone should be avoided
            crosses the placenta
      IVMP
        useful for systemic diseases that present with severe uveitis
        e.g. aggressive VKH
          IVMP 1 g daily x 3 days          then switch to prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day po
            ± OFT
          aggressive disease (VKH, Behcet) with heavy bilateral presentation
            start SSIMT at the same time as steroids
            can even consider combinations
              methotrexate + infliximab
              mycophenolate + cyclosporine
      for all systemic steroids
        counsel about side effects
          short term
            hyperglycemia
            weight gain
            depression
          long term
            osteoporosis
            thin skin
            peptic ulcers
            excess cortisol
              Cushing syndrome
                Cushingoid body habitus
                adrenal insufficiency

      isoniazid
      rifampin
      ethambutol
      pyrazinamide
  latent TB
    4 approved regimens
    various doses of

endogenous endophthalmitis
  history
    HIV
    hep C
    syphilis
    IVDU
    DM
    immunosuppressed
      transplant
      systemic steroids
      SSIMT
  exam
    venous puncture injection sites
    other sites of infection
    IOP
    evidence of prior episodes
      old KP
      PS
      CR scars
    active CR
    vasculitis
  COMMON:
    Strep
      pneumococcus
    SA
    Klebsiella
      East Asia
    fungal
      see below
  ALSO:
    Bacillus
    Neisseria
    E. coli
    H. flu
  RARELY:
    Nocardia
    Rickettsia
    Whipple disease
  sources
    liver abscess
    sinus infection
    endocarditis
    meningitis
    indwelling catheter
    source is only found in 1/2 of cases
  treatment
    systemic ± intravitreal
      systemic
        good vitreous penetration
          moxifloxacin
          levofloxacin
        moderate vitreous penetration
          ciprofloxacin
  fungal cause
    delayed onset 6+ weeks after seeding
    string of pearls
    fluffy subhyaloid infiltrates
    PPV + vitreous biopsy
      PPV is nearly always needed in fungal endophthalmitis
    intravitreal amphotericin B 5 micrograms
      cover for bacterial causes while waiting on results
        intravitreal
          vancomycin 1 mg
          ceftazidime 2.25 mg
        if penicillin allergic
          amikacin 0.4 mg/0.1 mL
          + clindamycin 1 mg/0.1 mL
    voriconazole 200 mg po q 12 hours
      also available IV
      excellent against
        Candida
        Aspergillus
      not as good as IV Amphotericin B for empiric coverage of others
        keep this in mind if they aren't responding
      keep them on po antifungals for 8 weeks
        ask for help
          ID consult
  bloods
    ALWAYS: blood cultures
    HIV Ab
    hep C Ab
    RPR
    FTA-ABS
    FBC
    serum glucose
    serum beta glucan assay
      high negative predictive value for invasive fungal infection
      combine with blood cultures
  imaging
    TEE for valve vegetations
  outcomes
    ~ 1/2 of patients achieve 6/60+
