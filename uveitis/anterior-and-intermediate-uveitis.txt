a separate panuveitis DDx is not helpful
    defining feature is choroidal/retinal involvement
        we already have a DDx for that

                        often a presenting complaint
                    glaucoma
                        patients have wide IOP fluctuations
                        follow them for glaucoma even if the IOP seems normal
                        get baseline glaucoma studies

                treatment
                    topical steroids are notoriously ineffective
                        sometimes trying and failing helps you make the diagnosis, however
                    most patients don't need treatment
                    for patients with severe floaters
                        OFT for vitritis is an option

                        IOP spikes
                            watch them carefully for postop elevation
                            once the pressure spikes it tends to resist treatment
                        perioperative steroids are OK
                            preop topical is probably enough
                            some surgeons use oral also
                            increase your postop steroids
                        acrylic IOLs are the least inflammatory
                    ALWAYS: address glaucoma even if the presenting IOP is normal

treatment

    when treating endophthalmitis
        mention systemic steroids
            1 mg/kg po prednisolone is expected in AU

    approach to noninfectious uveitis
        steroids
            topical steroids
                PF hourly
                taper at 5- WBC/HPF
                    start at qid
                    hold at each level for the time it took to reach 5- WBC/HPF on hourly
                        longer time to initial control means slower taper
                    if you use oral or injectable steroid to gain initial control
                        taper 1 drop every 4 weeks
            oral steroids
                if oral prednisolone is required for initial control
                    periocular triamcinolone may allow faster taper of systemic steroids
                        OFT 40 mg in 1 mL
                            plan on IOP elevation and cataract if used repeatedly
                            if inadequate but IOP OK
                                try IVT
                in pregnancy
                    prednisolone probably safe
                    triamcinolone unclear
                        probably OK as a local injection
                    dexamethasone should be avoided
                        crosses the placenta
            IVMP
                useful for systemic diseases that present with severe uveitis
                e.g. aggressive VKH
                    IVMP 1 g daily x 3 days          then switch to prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day po
                        ± OFT
                    aggressive disease (VKH, Behcet) with heavy bilateral presentation
                        start SSIMT at the same time as steroids
                        can even consider combinations
                            methotrexate + infliximab
                            mycophenolate + cyclosporine
            for all systemic steroids
                counsel about side effects

TB therapy
    TB disease
        4-drug therapy (I REP (you know, like a drug rep, get it???))
            isoniazid
            rifampin
            ethambutol
            pyrazinamide
        WHO recommends
            8 weeks of 4-drug therapy
            16 weeks of 2-drug therapy
                isoniazid
                rifampin
        but there is no consensus on treating intraocular TB
            BROADLY:
                6-12 months of treatment
                less than half of doctors use oral steroids
    latent TB
        4 approved regimens
        various doses of
            isoniazid only
            isoniazid + rifapentine
