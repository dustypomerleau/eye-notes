            if the disc or macula are threatened
              foscarnet 2.4 mg/0.1 mL intravitreally q 3 days until quiescent
            no need for steroids here
              generally no vitritis until immune reconstitution
              local immunosuppression is a risk factor for CMV retinitis
                has been reported multiple times after IVT
          if not better in 6 weeks consider drug-resistant CMV
          expect immune reconstitution 3-6 months after starting HAART

              classic regimen
                IV aciclovir 10-15 mg/kg q 8 hours x 1 week
                then switch to orals at therapeutic dose x 3+ months
              there is significant evidence for po only
                plasma concentration not quite as high as IV aciclovir
                  can achieve nearly the same by doubling the usual dose
                  not usually necessary to do this
                  certainly OK for peripheral disease
                most centers still give IV induction and then switch to po
                valaciclovir 1 g po tds x 3+ months

                    e.g. immunocompromised patients
              po prednisolone is debateable but widely used
                for exam purposes start 0.5-1 mg/kg 2 days after antivirals
                duration not well defined
                probably taper after 1 week if disease quiescent

              barrier laser to areas of extremely necrotic retina
                early PPV not supported by evidence
              usually use SO if patient needs a PPV
                not much evidence for this over gas but it's common practice

/*
From Katherine Zamecki & Doug Jabs (2010) RE: the value of A29 in diagnosing Birdshot:

The problem with using HLA typing diagnostically is illustrated in the case of BSCR. BSCR is associated with HLA-A29, and 85% to 95% of patients with BSCR possess HLA-A29, with an overall estimate of 90%. HLA-A29 is present in approximately 7.7% of the general population, and BSCR has among the highest relative odds of any HLA-associated disease. BSCR accounts for approximately 7% of posterior uveitis, and some clinicians advocate screening patients with posterior uveitis with HLA-A29 to diagnose BSCR. The problem with this approach is illustrated by Table 2, which shows the results of this strategy applied to 1000 patients with posterior uveitis. Despite the tight association of BSCR with HLA-A29, the positive predictive value of HLA-A29 is less than 50%, which means that diagnosing BSCR based on HLA-A29 results is wrong more often than it is right. If all uveitis patients were screened (as opposed to just posterior uveitis), the positive predictive value would be even lower, because the prevalence of BSCR is even lower among all patients with uveitis than it is among those with posterior uveitis. One could improve the positive predictive value of HLA-A29 testing by using it only in those situations where the patient had a multifocal choroiditis with yellow-orange ovoid spots, vitreous cells, no anterior chamber cells, and no evidence for syphilis, Lyme disease, or sarcoid. However, regardless of the HLA-A29 result, that patient would be diagnosed with BSCR (5% to 15% of patients with BSCR are HLA-A29 negative), so the test adds little to the diagnosis in this situation, either.

              PCR analysis for known oncogene translocations
            if the vitreous biopsy is negative and there are SR cells
              retinotomy with SR aspirate is an option
              the most common site of activity is actually the SRPE space
                hence the pigmentary changes overlying the lesion
            get setup for rapid transportation and processing of the sample
              lymphoma cells start to degrade within an hour
              preservatives can be added to try and delay this
        treatment
          systemic MTX
            ± Ara-C OR radiotherapy
            COMMON: IV
            ALSO: intrathecal
          intravitreal MTX 0.4 mg/0.1 mL for local control
            may require a large number of injections
              depends on concurrent effect of systemic therapy
            sample regimen
              twice a week for 4 weeks
              weekly for 8 weeks
              monthly for 9 months
              total injections = 25
      PCNSL
        COMMON: diffuse large B-cell NHL
      metastatic spread of systemic lymphoma
        key difference
          PIOL/PCNSL lymphoma cells mostly in the vitreous + retina/SR space
          metastatic lymphoma cells are mostly in the uvea
            these differences aren't absolute but help guide clinical suspicion
            primary uveal lymphoma is possible but RARE
      can masquerade as WDS OR retinal dystrophy
        peripheral pigmentary changes
        reduced ERG
    hematologic
      RARELY: leukemia
        usually
          IRH
          CWS
    metastatic
      COMMON:
        lung CA
        breast CA
        prostate CA
      usually mets to choroid
        true retinal mets are RARE but reported
