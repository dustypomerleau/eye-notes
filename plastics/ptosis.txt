ptosis exam
  cyclorefraction
    particularly important in children
    induced astigmatism can cause amblyopia
      even if the visual axis is clear
  pupils // Savino rule see pupils.txt
    CN3P
    Horner
      sympathetic anatomy
        1st order
          hypothalamus -> C8-T2 CSCB
        2nd order
          C8-T2 CSCB -> sympathetic chain in the neck -> SCG
        3rd order
          SCG -> ICA plexus -> long ciliary Ns
            cavernous sinus
            orbit
      Horner testing
        ALWAYS: drop both eyes
          you are making a comparison of responses
          post-drop measurements should be taken in a well-lit room
        cocaine 4-5% (classically 4, but often 5)
          prevents NE reuptake
          will fail to dilate any Horner patient
            they aren't producing NE
          positive test if post-drop anisocoria is 0.8+ mm
        apraclonidine 1%
          will only dilate a hypersensitive Horner pupil
            mostly alpha2
            alpha1 effect is not enough to dilate a normal pupil
            so the anisocoria will flip in a patient with Horner
              this is easier to detect than the cocaine endpoint
            NEVER: use apraclonidine in < 1 y baby
              causes CNS depression in infants
        phenylephrine 1% (dilute)
          will only dilate a hypersensitive Horner pupil
          same endpoint as apraclonidine
            anisocoria will flip in a patient with Horner
        hydroxyamphetamine 1%
          induces NE release
            will fail to dilate a 3rd-order Horner
          endpoint
            anisocoria gets bigger in a 3rd-order Horner
        so for Horner diagnosis
          cocaine will not dilate a Horner pupil
            not commonly used but ALWAYS mention it on exams
          apraclonidine OR (dilute) phenylephrine
            will only dilate a Horner pupil
            flips the anisocoria if positive
        and for Horner localization
          hydroxyamphetamine will only dilate if the 3rd-order neuron is intact
            i.e. Horner is 1st or 2nd order
        all the agents except cocaine are 1%
        in practice
          if there is acute onset of Horner with neck pain
            you don't have time to do this pharmacologic testing before imaging
            ALWAYS: MRI + MRA to exclude carotid dissection first
              brain
                medullary tumor OR infarct
                  Wallenberg syndrome AKA lateral medullary syndrome
              C + T spine
              neck
                carotid dissection
                  look for high-intensity T1 crescent in the carotid
                    easiest to see in axial views
              apical chest
                Pancoast tumor
                metastatic neuroblastoma
            most institutions have a Horner protocol for imaging these areas
              many use CT + CTA instead of MRI + MRA
            if there is a dissection
              ADMIT to neurology
                they will dictate anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy
                  still controversial which you choose
                some carotid dissections are amenable to intervention

    good way to check your numbers
  lid crease position
    mm from lid margin
  levator function
    downgaze to upgaze
    don't let them use the frontalis
      put pressure on the brow if you need to
    4- mm needs a sling
    8+ mm is perfect for levator advancement
    in between is a gray zone
      careful with big levator advancements
      can lift the lid off the cornea and cause OSD
  Muller function
    phenylephrine test
      1.5+ mm is positive

surgical treatment
  Mullerectomy + conjunctival resection
    2- mm with a positive phenylephrine test
    avoid epi in the local infiltration to keep measurements accurate
  Fasanella-Servat
    2- mm with a positive OR negative phenylephrine test
    not quite as predictable as Mullerectomy
    mainly tarsectomy + small mullerectomy
      so still effective even with a negative phenylephrine test
      if they do have a positive phenylephrine test
        do a Mullerectomy
  levator advancement
    can correct 2- mm but is best for 3–4 mm
      patients with 4+ mm ptosis often have poor levator function
        in that case you need a sling anyway
    allows you to adjust the height on the table
      much more predictable under local anesthesia
    allows concurrent blepharoplasty
      aponeurotic ptosis repair (anterior approach):
        mark the skin to show the lid apex and a mini-blepharoplasty
        local anesthetic infiltration front and back
        excise the mini-bleph
        clear OOM off the tarsus
        ask patient to look up
          identify the tugging of the levator
        open through the septum
          levator is right underneath
        identify the orbital fat pad superiorly
          undermine a bit so you are just holding levator
        double-armed 5–0 ethibond suture
          passed horizontally through the tarsus
          just above the lid apex you marked
        evert the lid
          ensure you didn't pass full-thickness
        2nd suture further laterally
        pull the levator aponeurosis down
          pass the 2 double-armed sutures through the middle to upper part of the aponeurosis
        tie a couple throws over a loop
          check the lid position to make sure you're happy before locking
        goal is to have the lid margin in line with the superior limbus
          lid will sit a touch higher than the actual postoperative result
            2° epinephrine in the anesthetic
        trim off excess levator in front of the sutures
        close the OOM
          capture a small bite of the levator to re-form the lid crease
        close the skin
          running 6–0 prolene
          plan removal about a week after surgery

From an article contributed by Dr. Dresner to the medical textbook Oculoplasty
Surgery: The Essentials, edited by William P. Chen. New York: Thieme Medical
Publishers, 2001.

Ptosis of the upper eyelid is a condition in which the upper eyelid margin is
in an abnormal inferiorly displaced position. It may cover a significant
portion of the cornea and pupillary aperture so as to cause visual
impairment. The treatment of ptosis requires accurate and consistent
evaluation and measurement as well as skillful use of surgical techniques to
implement a functional and esthetic correction.

This article describes evaluation and measurement of ptosis, the corrections
for minimal ptosis (Mülllerectomy, Fasanella-Servat procedure), and levator
aponeurotic repair for patients with involutional changes. Frontalis
suspension and Whitnall's sling are presented.

EVALUATION OF A PTOSIS PATIENT
The history is important in evaluating the ptosis patient. If the ptosis is
congenital, one should question the patient or family as to the absence or
presence of jaw winking. With acquired ptosis, a history of fatigability
would warrant a workup for myasthenia gravis. Any history of trauma, previous
ocular history , or contact lens wear may also be germane.

There are numerous classifications for ptosis, such as congenital versus
acquired, neurogenic, myogenic, traumatic, and mechanical.1 None of these
classifications, however, provides a practical approach or system for repair.
On a practical basis, ptosis can be viewed as either minimal, moderate, or
severe. A logical system with appropriate choices can then be applied to each
of these three categories.

Ocular Exam
In addition to documenting the visual acuity, the patient's ocular motility
and pupillary function should be evaluated. Any anisocoria suspicious for
Homer's syndrome should be fully worked up. The presence or absence of Bell's
phenomenon should be documented as well as the tear film and breakup, cornea,
and quantitative tear functions. Children with ptosis should have
full-dilated exams, retinoscopy, and assessment of amblyopia.

Ptosis Assessment and Documentation
The amount of ptosis is important to document to the nearest 0.5 mm if
possible. This is better documented by the margin-to-reflex distance 1
(MRD1),2 which is the distance from the central pupillary light reflex to the
upper eyelid margin. The margin-to-reflex distance 2 (MRD2) is the distance
from the central pupillary light reflex to the lower eyelid margin. The MRD1
plus the MRD2 should equal the palpebral fissure measurement.

The levator excursion is the best clinical test of levator function. The
levator excursion is documented in millimeters, measuring the distance from
extreme up gaze to downgaze with the brow immobilized by the examiner's thumb
to eliminate any contribution of the brow to lid elevation. A millimeter
ruler is used vertically in the pupillary axis to assess the full excursion.
Levator excursion of 10 mm or greater is considered good function, 5 to 9 mm
of excursion is fair function, and 4 mm or less is poor function.

Patients with minimal ptosis (2 mm or less) should have a phenylephrine test
performed in the involved eye or eyes after appropriate ptosis measurements
have been evaluated and documented. Either 2.5 or 10% phenylephrine is
instilled in the affected eye or eyes. Usually two drops are placed and the
patient is reexamined 5 minutes later. The MRD1 is rechecked in the affected
and unaffected eyes . A rise in the MRDl of 1.5 mm or greater is considered a
positive test. This indicates that Müller's muscle is viable, and the
Müller's muscle conjunctival resection procedure can be performed. It may
also give the patient a reasonable prediction of the desired result.

The contralateral eye must also be rechecked in patients with unilateral
ptosis. With the ptotic eye occluded, if the MRDl decreases appreciably in
the opposite eye, this usually indicates that bilateral ptosis is present,
consistent with Hering's law.3 This may necessitate bilateral surgery. A
negative phenylephrine test precludes the use of the Müller's muscle
conjunctival procedure because of the unpredictability of the procedure in
this setting.2

Callahan and Beard1 have stated that minimal or mild ptosis is 2 mm or less,
moderate ptosis is 3 to 4 mm, and severe ptosis is 4 mm or greater. Usually
patients with minimal ptosis will have good levator excursions. The
moderate-ptosis patients usually have good to fair excursion, and, typically,
patients with severe ptosis have poor levator excursions.

Surgical Options Based on Levator Function
For patients with minimal ptosis (2 mm or less) there are three viable
options: (1) Müller's muscle conjunctival resection, (2) Fasanella-Servat, or
(3) levator aponeurotic surgery. If the phenylephrine test is positive in the
affected eyelid or eyelids, the Müller's muscle conjunctival resection
procedure is the most precise and predictable surgical option.2 For many
ptosis surgeons, this is the preferred approach for minimal ptosis because of
its ease, predictability, and the ability to grade the correction. If,
however, the phenylephrine test is negative, one must consider other
procedures due to the unpredictability of Müller's muscle conjunctival
resection in this setting. The Fasanella-Servat procedure is the next option
that should be considered with minimal ptosis and a negative phenylephrine
test. The Fasanella-Servat procedure, although not quite as predictable as
Müller's muscle conjunctival resection, is nearly as predictable and equally
easy to perform.4  Because it is in a sense a tarsectomy with little Müller's
muscle resected, it is viable in the absence of a positive phenylephrine test.

Levator aponeurotic repair is the third option for minimal ptosis. Many
surgeons prefer this technique because of the ability to set the eyelid height
on the operating table. It is quite useful for patients who have contour
abnormalities and who have ptosis requiring concomitant blepharoplasty.5
There are, however, many variables that may affect the results, including the
need for patient cooperation, the effects of sedation or local anesthetic
infiltration, and the need to overcorrect the affected side or sides on the
operating room table. It is also difficult to grade under general
anesthesia. Indeed, many reports have suggested that predictability and
success with this procedure may vary up to within 2 mm of the other affected
eyelid.6,7 However, in the setting of minimal ptosis, success ought to be
judged to within 0.5 mm. Nonetheless, levator aponeurotic repair is useful
for many minimal ptosis patients.

Levator aponeurotic repair is the treatment of choice for nearly all patients
with moderate ptosis. These patients usually have good to fair levator
excursions, and usually have negative phenylephrine tests.

Patients with severe ptosis typically have poor levator excursions and require
some type of frontalis suspension. Patients with unilateral congenital ptosis
and levator excursions of only 4 to 5 mm are often helped with Whitnall slings
or maximal levator aponeurotic advancement. This can be augmented by
simultaneous tarsectomy as well.

Bilateral severe ptosis patients, or patients with very poor levator
excursion, need some type of frontalis suspension. Congenital severe ptosis
with little levator excursion is best served with autogenous fascia lata
grafts. Nonautogenous materials are available and can be used if necessary;
however, the long-term results are poorer than with autogenous materials.8
Acquired severe ptosis, such as seen with third nerve palsy, progressive
external ophthalmoplegia, or oculopharyngeal dystrophy, is best treated by
frontalis suspension using a silicone (Silastic) rod because of its
adjustability and the possibility for subsequent removal if the cornea becomes
compromised.9

SURGICAL MANAGEMENT
Müller's Muscle Conjunctival Resection
Müller's muscle conjunctival resection is reserved for patients with minimal
ptosis (2 mm or less) with normal levator excursion and a positive
phenylephrine test. This technique was originally described by Putterman and
Urist10 in 1975. Various modifications have been described to modify this
technique.2,11

Müller's muscle is a smooth muscle that originates from the undersurface of
the levator and inserts with a 0.5 to 1 mm tendon into the superior tarsal
plate12 When denervated in Horner's syndrome, this muscle relaxes, causing 2
to 3 mm of clinical blepharoptosis. The levator aponeurosis has been shown to
insert on the anterior 7 to 8 mm of the upper tarsus, with additional
interdigitations to the orbicularis oculi's intermuscular septum, forming the
eyelid crease.13 Whitnall, however, recognized Müller's muscle as another
important primary attachment or insertion of the levator. When Müller's
muscle is advanced, it strengthens the posterior lamella and appears to
plicate the levator aponeurosis with healing and subsequent scarring in the
posterior lamella. This plication is successful in maintaining a permanent
elevated position of the upper eyelid.2

Surgical Technique

A frontal nerve block is unnecessary for this procedure; lor 2% Xylocaine is
used as a regional block for the upper eyelid. Epinephrine is omitted to
avoid stimulation of Müller's muscle; 2 to 3 cc of the solution mixed with
hyaluronidase (10 cc anesthetic mixed with 150 units hyaluronidase Wydase) is
injected just below the superior orbital rim. Tetracaine topical anesthetic
eye drops are then placed on the conjunctival surface. A 4–0 silk suture is
placed through the tarsus at the eyelid margin in the pupillary axis. The
eyelid is reflected over a Desmarres retractor. Marks are made at one-half
the distance of the total resection amount medially, centrally, and laterally,
measured with a caliper and beginning 0.5 mm above the tarsal plate. Another
mark is made centrally to measure the total extent of resection desired.4

Three 4–0 silk traction sutures are placed through the conjunctiva and
Müller's muscle centrally, medially, and laterally at the halfway marks. Each
bite is approximately 3 mm long and deep to the underlying Müller's muscle,
but should not penetrate the levator aponeurosis or orbicularis muscle. The
sutures are separated into two bundles and tied on themselves, to be used as
traction sutures to elevate the required amount of conjunctiva and Müller's
muscle to be resected .5

The Desmarres retractor is removed and the lid marginal suture is clamped
superiorly to the head drape. The bundles of sutures are elevated. One
bundle is held by the surgeon and the other by an assistant. The Müller's
muscle conjunctival resection clamp (Karl Ilg Instruments, Villa Park, IL) is
placed over the elevated tissues. The clamp is placed so that the most
superior central mark is adjacent to the resection clamp.

A 6–0 plain suture is placed under the clamp with a horizontal mattress
technique approximately 0.5 to 1 mm below the clamp . The clamp tissues are
excised with a no.15 blade, metal on metal . The conjunctiva is closed with a
running baseball stitch in the reverse direction of the original pass. The
suture is tied on itself . Exteriorizing the suture is not required. The
eyelid is returned to its anatomic position and the eyelid margin suture is
removed. Antibiotic ointment is placed in the eye. No patch is necessary.

Excellent results can be seen with minimal ptosis ranging between 1 and 2 mm
. The advantages of this technique are that it is quick, predictable, and
quantifiable. Late failures are quite rare.

Complications include a rare superior corneal abrasion, undercorrection, or
overcorrection. Usually an abrasion heals spontaneously if it is small. A
bandage contact lens can also be placed if desired. Overcorrection is rare
with this technique. If it occurs, the plain suture can be cut under topical
anesthetic in the office, and the wound can be separated gently with a cotton
swab. Undercorrection requires another procedure at a later date.

FasaneIla-Servat Procedure
In 1961 Fasanella and Servat described their tarsectomy operation for
correcting small amounts of ptosis in patients with normal levator function.
In 1972 Putterman14 developed a clamp to supplant the use of curved hemostats
for the Fasanella-Servat procedure. This clamp is best known today for its
use in the Müller's muscle conjunctival resection procedure. The
Fasanella-Servat procedure is well suited for minimal ptosis. Because
patients with a positive phenylephrine test are treated with a Müller's muscle
conjunctival resection procedure, the Fasanella is reserved for patients with
minimal ptosis and a negative phenylephrine test who do not require
blepharoplasty.

Surgical Technique

Fasanella and Servat described performing their procedure with two curved
hemostats. Placing these hemostats can be cumbersome, and malplacement can
lead to postoperative contour abnormalities or central peaking. A modified
Putterman clamp (Karl Ilg) can be used in place of the two hemostats . This
clamp is modified with a screw closure, which assists in crushing the tarsus.

Anesthesia is obtained by injecting 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 dilution
epinephrine and hyaluronidase through the superior cul-de-sac. The eyelid is
everted and two 4–0 silk sutures are placed through the conjunctival tarsal
border medially and laterally . The tarsus is marked centrally along the
pupillary axis, measuring the proposed resection amount. One millimeter of
tarsus should be resected for each millimeter of ptosis. The tissues are
elevated via the two traction sutures and the clamp is placed over the tarsus
and conjunctiva . The screw device is turned until the tissues are firmly
secured. A 6–0 polypropylene (Prolene) suture is placed through the anterior
lamella under the clamp, then passed back and forth in a horizontal mattress
fashion and exteriorized out the anterior skin lamella at the other end of the
clamp.14 The clamped tissues are excised with a no.15 blade . The eyelid is
reflected back in its anatomic position and the suture is tied over itself
along the pretarsal area. The suture is removed in 5 to 7 days.

Although this procedure is not as predictable as the Müller's muscle
conjunctival resection procedure, it is nearly so, and can yield excellent
results in patients who have 1 to 2 mm of ptosis . Correction of 3 mm of
ptosis is not recommended with this procedure because of the need to excise
large amounts of tarsus.

Complications include undercorrection, overcorrection, and the rare corneal
epithelial defect. Overcorrections can usually be treated by early removal of
the suture and by digital massage. Undercorrections will need either a
full-thickness eyelid resection or a levator aponeurotic repair.

This procedure can be performed on patients with or without positive
phenylephrine tests; however, patients with a positive phenylephrine test are
usually better served with Müller's muscle conjunctival resection. The
advantages of this modified Fasanella-Servat technique include avoiding the
need for two hemostats, the absence of contour abnormalities, and the ability
to quantitate the procedure well.

Levator Aponeurotic Repair
Levator aponeurotic repair is useful for minimal to moderate ptosis and can be
employed if Müller's muscle conjunctival resection or Fasanella-Servat are not
indicated, such as in patients with a large conjunctival filtering bleb or
when concomitant blepharoplasty is desired. For moderate ptosis (3 to 4 mm),
it is the procedure of choice. A maximallevator aponeurotic advancement or
Whitnall sling can be employed for patients with severe unilateral ptosis.
This can be further augmented by excising additional amounts of tarsus to
elevate the eyelid margin.

The levator palpebral superioris extends from the annulus of Zinn posteriorly
through the superior orbit to Whitnall's ligament, which serves as a
suspensory ligament for the upper eyelid . At this point the muscle becomes
aponeurotic and whitish in appearance. The aponeurosis courses downward to
insert on the inferior two thirds of the anterior surface of the tarsal plate,
the fibrous septi of the orbicularis and the subcutaneous tissues.15 Further
anterior to the aponeurosis is the pre-aponeurotic fat pad and the orbital
septum.

Surgical Technique

The procedure is best performed under local anesthetic with minimal
intravenous sedation. Small amounts of local anesthetic are used to avoid
paralyzing the levator muscle. Epinephrine is recommended for adequate
hemostasis. Approximately 1 to 2 cc of 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine is
usually sufficient.

The eyelid crease is marked prior to local infiltration. If unilateral ptosis
is to be performed, the incision is marked approximately 1 mm below the crease
on the opposite eyelid, because postoperatively the crease will rise
slightly. If bilateral surgery is planned, the incision can be symmetrically
placed at the desired location, but placing the incision too high beyond the
superior tarsal border of the upper tarsus should be avoided.

After the local anesthetic is injected on the lid, topical tetracaine eye
drops are placed on the conjunctival surface. The patient is prepped, and
protective corneal shields can be placed over the globes. The incision can be
made with a no.15 Bard-Parker blade or a CO2 laser set to incisional mode. A
skin-muscle flap is developed to expose the orbital septum. The septum is
incised over the upper one third to avoid incising or damaging the underlying
levator .21 The preaponeurotic fat pad is reflected upward and the whitish
aponeurosis is seen underneath. A high-temperature hand-held cautery is used
to disinsert the aponeurosis from the tarsal plate, which separates the
aponeurosis from the underlying Müller's muscle . Dissection is carried
upward, as high as Whitnall's ligament if necessary. A double-arm 6–0 Vicryl
suture is placed partial thickness through the central portion of the upper
tarsus in two 3 mm bites. This suture is then taken up through the
aponeurosis at the desired height . This is temporarily tied and the level is
examined. Usually sitting the patient up on the table gives a more accurate
assessment. A 1 to 1.5 mm overcorrection is desirable, because the
protractors (orbicularis) are paralyzed by local anesthetic and there can be
some stimulation of Müller's muscle by the epinephrine. Additional sutures
can be placed medially and laterally for contour adjustment; however, often
they are unnecessary. The excess levator aponeurosis is trimmed. A strip of
skin-orbicularis flap superiorly can be excised if necessary, or bilateral
blepharoplasties can be performed with this surgical technique. The wound is
then closed with a 6–0 suture of choice with supratarsal fixation on every
other bite of the suture. Excellent results can be obtained with this
approach.

Whitnall Sling
The Whitnall sling procedure is a maximal levator aponeurotic advancement. In
actuality, the levator muscle's Whitnall's ligament is sewn to the superior
tarsal plate without cutting the medial and lateral horns of the levator and
aponeurosis. This is usually utilized in unilateral congenital ptosis with
levator function in the 5 mm range.

Surgical Technique

Because this technique is often performed under general anesthesia, an
empirical formula needs to be used to set the height of the lid margin. The
gaping technique described by McCord16 suggests that in congenital ptosis, one
adds 3 mm to the amount of ptosis present and that this amount of gaping or
lagophthalmos is established on the operating table. For instance, if there
is 3 mm of ptosis present, the eyes should be left open 6 mm on the operating
table. Another formula is to subtract the levator excursion in the affected
eyelid from the normal side of excursion. This number is then multiplied by
1.2 to identify the amount of levator aponeurotic advancement. For example,
if one side has an excursion of 6 mm and the other side is 14 mm, then the
levator is advanced 9.6mm.

If additional elevation is required, a tarsectomy can be performed at the time
of Whitnall's sling. 2 to 4 mm of tarsus can be excised at the time of
surgery. With this method, each millimeter of tarsus is equivalent to 2 mm of
aponeurotic advancement.

Complications with aponeurotic surgery include contour abnormalities,
overcorrection, and undercorrection. Conjunctival prolapse is rare. These
complications are usually best addressed 1 week postsurgery.7 With
overcorrections, the wound can be opened and the aponeurotic sutures cut. The
aponeurosis is recessed slightly with cotton swabs and the eyelid level is
reassessed. Undercorrections are opened and the aponeurosis adyanced
appropriately. Contour abnormalities are handled in a similar fashion.

Frontalis Suspension Using Fascia Lata
Patients with severe ptosis and poor levator function are candidates for
frontalis suspension with autogenous fascia lata. Patients with synkinetic
ptosis (Marcus-Gunn jaw-winking ptosis) may also be candidates for this
procedure with or without levator extirpation. Generally, autogenous fascia
lata gives more predictable and long-lasting results.7 Eye-bank-preserved
tissues can be utilized when the patient is younger than 3 years of age or at
the family's request.

Autogenous fascia lata is easy to harvest freehand, obviating the need for
fascial strippers. A 3 to 4 cm incision is marked in the midthigh
longitudinally, halfway between the head of the fibula and the anterior
superior iliac spine . Although this procedure is usually performed under
general anesthesia, 0.5% Marcaine with 1:100,000 dilution epinephrine is
injected subcutaneously for hemostasis and postoperatively analgesia. The
foot is pronated slightly by a nonscrubbed assistant or can be taped to
immobilize the leg and place the fascia lata on stretch. The incision is
begun with a no.15 Bard-Parker blade, and dissection is carried down through
the subcutaneous fat to the fascia. For bilateral surgery , a harvested strip
of fascia needs to be at least 6 mm in width and 8 to 10 cm in length. Two
incisions are made 8 to 10 cm apart into the fascia with a no.15 Bard-Parker
blade. The fascia is exposed superiorly and inferiorly by dissecting bluntly
with small "peanuts" (small wrapped cotton balls). A surgical assistant moves
along the incisions with army-navy retractors to expose the field. Using long
Metzenbaum scissors, the fascial strips are incised lengthwise. The strip is
transected on both ends with curved scissors or Jorgenson's scissors, and
pulled out of the wound. The fascia lata is not repaired. The subcutaneous
tissues are closed with 4–0 or 5–0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin can be closed
with a 5–0 plain suture.

Surgical Technique

A number of patterns for frontalis suspensions have been described. A simple
pentangular pattern is useful for both fascia lata and silicone rod and
requires a limited length of material.

Local anesthetic with epinephrine is injected pretarsally and to the suprabrow
region. Two incisions are marked adjacent to the medial and lateral corneal
limbus over the midtarsus. Three-millimeter incisions are made down to the
tarsal plate. A 2 to 3 mm width fascial strip is then pulled through the
incisions with a Wright fascia lata needle. The fascial strips can be pulled
upward to the medial and lateral eyebrow to mark the two brow incisions,
ensuring a proper vector and eyelid contour. The medial and lateral suprabrow
incisions are incised down to the periosteum with a no.15 Bard-Parker blade.
While the globe is protected by a lid plate, a Wright needle is passed
downward from the medial and lateral brow incisions through the preaponeurotic
fat pads to the lid incisions. The fascia strip is then pulled through the
medial and lateral brow incisions. It is then crossed centrally over the
pupil to mark the central incision, at a point 4 to 5 mm above the two
incisions. The central incision is made down to the periosteum and the two
ends of the fascial strip are tunneled into the central incision with the
Wright needle. This approach helps to ensure the proper vectors of pull and a
normal eyelid contour. The fascia is pulled up until the lid margin
approximates the upper limbus and is then tied with one half of a surgeon's
knot. A 6–0 Prolene suture or braided nylon suture is sewn through the
knotted strips and tied, securing the knot. It is then sewn into the
frontalis muscles superiorly. Excess fascia is trimmed, and 4 to 5 mm of
remnant fascia is tucked into the central incision. The lid and brow
incisions are then closed with 6–0 plain suture.

Variation

A variation of this technique can be performed by making a lid crease incision
and sewing the fascia directly to the tarsal plate. This is helpful in some
instances when one wants to excise excess skin or to provide a more defined
lid crease. The pretarsal incision technique described previously, however,
is faster and creates an appropriate upper eyelid crease.

Frontalis Suspension Using a Silicone (Silastic) Rod
Silicone (Silastic) rod suspension is useful in myogenic ptosis conditions
such as progressive external ophthalmoplegia, oculopharyngeal dystrophy, and
myasthenia gravis, or in third nerve palsy patients. Rarely, an adult with
severe bilateral congenital ptosis with no previous surgical correction or
with undercorrection from previous surgeries may present with absent or poor
Bell's protective eye phenomenon. These patients are usually better served
with silicone rod frontalis suspension.

Silicone rod frontalis suspension is recommended in patients with progressive
neuromuscular disorders and third nerve palsy because of the possibility of
recovery of illness, possible favorable response to therapeutics, and
allowance for postoperative adjustment. The 1 mm solid silicone (Silastic)
rods are available commercially . The Silastic rod package comes with passing
needles and Silastic sleeve, which eliminate the need for the Wright fascia
lata needle.

Surgical Technique

The surgery can be done under general anesthesia or local anesthesia; however
local anesthesia is preferred to fine-tune the eyelid level and contour
intraoperatively. A simple pentangular design similar to what is used for the
fascial frontalis suspension works well for this procedure. A lid crease
incision, however, is more appropriate in this case to attach the silicone rod
directly to the tarsal plate.

One percent Xylocaine with epinephrine and hyaluronidase is injected under the
lid crease incision and just above the eyebrow centrally, medially, and
laterally. The lid crease incision is made and the tarsal plate is exposed by
dissection through the orbicularis. The silicone rod is sewn onto the tarsal
plate with three to five interrupted 6–0 braided nylon or polypropylene. The
rod is then pulled up to the eyebrow to mark the medial and lateral brow
incisions. This will help to optimize the contour of the upper eyelid
margin. Incisions are made down to the periosteum. With the globe protected,
the rods are passed through the preaponeurotic space to the medial and lateral
brow incisions with the passing needles . The medial and lateral ends of the
Silastic rod are then pulled up and crossed centrally to mark the central
incision. This is usually above the pupil or just medial to the pupil. The
two ends of the rod are passed through a small Silastic sleeve to secure them
at an optimum length and tension. The lid level is set between 1 and 3 mm
above the pupil, depending on the condition being treated. (One should not
elevate these lids to the limbus, as one does with congenital ptosis.) The
rods are trimmed and left with 5 to 8 mm of length on either end for possible
future adjustment. The ends of these rods are then tucked into the wound. A
6–0 braided nylon or polypropylene suture is sewn around the sleeve, which is
then sewn superiorly to the deeper frontalis muscle . The brow incisions are
closed and the lid crease incision is closed, usually with supratarsal
fixation every other bite to create a defined lid crease. One can adjust the
lid level and contour postoperatively in the office by exposing the Silastic
sleeve under the central suprabrow incision. This is best done within the
first few weeks after surgery because once a pseudocapsule forms around the
rods, adjustment may be more difficult. If indicated, the rod can be entirely
removed at any time postoperatively. The Silastic rod offers the extra
advantage and flexibility of adjustability, and comparable results to fascia
lata techniques can be obtained.
