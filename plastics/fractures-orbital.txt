orbital fractures

ALWAYS: confirm that the globe is intact before proceeding with exam

exam
    oculocardiac reflex
        bradycardia
    complete eye exam for associated injury
        first rule out globe rupture
        acuity
        pupils
        IOP
            1° versus upgaze
        color
        anterior uveitis
        hyphema
        angle recession
            gonio
        cataract
        zonular dehiscence
            subluxation
        VH
        optic neuropathy
        commotio
        choroidal rupture
        retinal tear
        RRD
        periocular
            medial canthal rounding
            traumatic telecanthus
    ecchymosis
    enophthalmos
        Hertel
    hypoglobus
    EOMs
        ductions
        versions
        forced ductions
            both paretic and restrictive elements are possible with trauma
        force generation test
        cover testing in all gazes
        Hess chart
    saccadic velocity
    lid lag in downgaze
    infraorbital nerve hypoesthesia

investigations
    non-contrast CT
        fractures
        orbital apex syndrome
        orbital emphysema
        brain tissue prolapse

treatment
    canthotomy and cantholysis for orbital compartment syndrome
    urgent repair
        bradycardia
    repair 1–2 weeks (max 4 weeks)
        diplopia in 1° + positive forced ductions
        large fracture
            1/2+ the orbital floor
        enophthalmos 2+ mm
    surgery
        infraciliary OR conjunctival
        miniplating
        alloplastic implant
        complications
            over or undercorrection
            lid retraction
            infraorbital nerve damage
            damage to lacrimal system
            infected implant
            extruded implant
        neurosurgery assist
            brain prolapse
            CSF leak
    if the patient presents late (months later)
        orbital floor may not be reparable
        can attempt subperiosteal implant if patient has realistic expectations
        may need to manage diplopia with strabismus surgery

enophthalmos DDx
    orbital floor fracture
    silent sinus syndrome // picture hypoglobus/enophthalmos with finger to lips
        chronic maxillary sinusitis
            ostium gets blocked
            negative pressure develops
        collapse of the orbital floor
            enophthalmos
            hypoglobus
            diplopia
        CT is diagnostic
    sclerosing orbital tumor
        COMMON: breast CA
    bony erosion
        orbital varix
            valsalva should push the eye out
    orbital fat atrophy
        age
        trauma
        surgery
            after orbital decompression for TED
        medications
