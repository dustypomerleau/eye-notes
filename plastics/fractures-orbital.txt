orbital fractures

ALWAYS: confirm that the globe is intact before proceeding with exam

exam
  oculocardiac reflex
    bradycardia
  complete eye exam for associated injury
    first rule out globe rupture
    acuity
    pupils
    IOP
      1˚ versus upgaze
    color
    anterior uveitis
    hyphema
    angle recession
      gonio
    cataract
    zonular dehiscence
      subluxation
    VH
    optic neuropathy
    commotio
    choroidal rupture
    retinal tear
    RRD
    periocular
      medial canthal rounding
      traumatic telecanthus
  ecchymosis
  enophthalmos
    Hertel
  hypoglobus
  EOMs
    ductions
    versions
    forced ductions
      both paretic and restrictive elements are possible with trauma
    force generation test
    cover testing in all gazes
    Hess chart
  saccadic velocity
  lid lag in downgaze
  infraorbital nerve hypoesthesia

investigations
  non-contrast CT
    fractures
    orbital apex syndrome
    orbital emphysema
    brain tissue prolapse

treatment
  canthotomy and cantholysis for orbital compartment syndrome
  urgent repair
    bradycardia
  repair 1–2 weeks (max 4 weeks)
    diplopia in 1˚ + positive forced ductions
    large fracture
      1/2+ the orbital floor
    enophthalmos 2+ mm
  surgery
    infraciliary OR conjunctival
    miniplating
    alloplastic implant
    complications
      over or undercorrection
      lid retraction
      infraorbital nerve damage
      damage to lacrimal system
      infected implant
      extruded implant
    neurosurgery assist
      brain prolapse
      CSF leak
  if the patient presents late (months later)
    orbital floor may not be reparable
    can attempt subperiosteal implant if patient has realistic expectations
    may need to manage diplopia with strabismus surgery

enophthalmos DDx
  orbital floor fracture
  silent sinus syndrome // picture hypoglobus/enophthalmos with finger to lips
    chronic maxillary sinusitis
      ostium gets blocked
      negative pressure develops
    collapse of the orbital floor
      enophthalmos
      hypoglobus
      diplopia
    CT is diagnostic
  sclerosing orbital tumor
    COMMON: breast CA
  bony erosion
    orbital varix
      valsalva should push the eye out
  orbital fat atrophy
    age
    trauma
    surgery
      after orbital decompression for TED
    medications
      prostaglandin-associated periorbitopathy
  radiation
  pseudoenophthalmos
    ptosis
    microphthalmia
    fellow eye proptosis
