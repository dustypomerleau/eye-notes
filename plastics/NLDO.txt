NLDO

  congenital NLDO
    mucoid reflux
    sac distention with digital pressure
    watch for a year and massage the sac
    probe and irrigate in OT
      ALWAYS: irrigate to prove patency after probing
    if recurrent
      intubate with Crawford tubing
        ± turbinate infracture if URI-associated
      tubing removal in 3-6 months
    DCR if this fails
    watch for dacryocystitis // treatment below

    approach to the patient with epiphora
      hypersecretion
        OSD
        any inflammatory or infectious KC
        unanesthetized Schirmer1 helps rule out excessive tearing
      poor lacrimal drainage

              dye disappearance test
                should be gone in 5 minutes
                high false positive rate
                  but if the dye disappears it helps you
                if the dye doesn't disappear
                  do a Jones1 with an anesthetized swab in the nose
                    below the inferior turbinate
                    if you get dye the system is patent
                      reassess for hypersecretion
                    if you don't get dye then probe and irrigate
              probing and irrigation
                NEVER: irrigate in the setting of active dacryocystitis
                local anesthetic
                wash out previous fluorescein
                dilate the punctum
                saline in a syringe with a 26 g lacrimal cannula
                horizontal traction
                enter punctum and canaliculus
                  irrigate
                if irrigation is successful
                  including from the sac // see below
                  do a Jones2 with an anesthetized swab in the nose
                    below the inferior turbinate
                    if you retrieve dye it means it entered the sac before
                      the patient probably has a partial obstruction/stenosis
                    if you don't retrieve dye
                      the obstruction is probably at or before the common
                if irrigation fails
                  attempt to pass probe into the sac
                    soft stop
                      canaliculus is blocked
                        reflux through the lower punctum
                          indicates lower canaliculus is blocked
                        reflux through the upper punctum
                          indicates common canaliculus is blocked
                    hard stop
                      you've reached the lacrimal bone at the medial sac wall
                        try to irrigate again from this point
                          the lacrimal system may simply be stenosed
                        if irrigation fails
                          lacrimal sac might visibly distend
                          expect upper punctal reflux
                            note the type of reflux
