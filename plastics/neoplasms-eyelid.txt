eyelid neoplasms

/*
with any skin or orbit lesion
    first goal is establish the diagnosis
        biopsy if it's uncertain
    with skin cancer the key is margin control
        Mohs is generally best if available
        24 h paraffin probably second
            wait until day 2 to repair the defect
                that way you can do further excision if necessary
        routine frozen section can miss things but is better than nothing
    for cancer in the orbit the patient needs complete staging with an oncologist
        i.e. is it confined to the orbit or not? // see mass-orbital.txt

history
    pace of onset
    sun exposure
    prior skin cancer
    smoking
    radiation
    immunosuppression

exam
    ulceration
    bleeding
    telangiectasias
    pigment
    loss of architecture
    pagetoid spread to conjunctiva, sclera
    perineural spread
        test CN5 and CN7
    palpate regional lymph nodes
    punctal or canalicular involvement
    masquerading as chronic chalazia or blepharitis
    ALWAYS: perform a complete eye exam

DDx
    size influences biopsy type
        incisional
            in practice
                usually a 3 mm punch biopsy under local anesthesia
        excisional

    benign
        generally observe
        if cystic
            shave
            marsupialize
        if viral OR small/multifocal
            electrocautery
            cryo
        squamous papilloma
        seborrheic keratosis
        epidermal inclusion cysts
            contains yellow-white laminated keratin
        milia
            multiple
            keratin filled
        sweat gland cysts
            COMMON: syringomas
                multifocal bumps
                clear contents (not yellow like xanthelasma)
            ALSO: sudoriforous cyst AKA hidrocystoma AKA cyst of Moll
                transilluminates
                can be apocrine or eccrine in origin
                apocrine hidrocystoma can be multiple
                    often near the eyelid margin
        molluscum
        xanthelasma
        trichoepithelioma
            most common of many benign tumors of hair follicles
        nevi
            can be pearly and nonpigmented like a BCC
            but
                conform to the globe
                no ulceration
                lashes and lid architecture are not disturbed
            if nonpigmented
                vessels may be prominent
        oculodermal melanocytosis AKA nevus of Ota
            RARELY: develops uveal melanoma
        pyogenic granuloma AKA lobular capillary hemangioma
            COMMON: at a site of trauma
        granulation tissue polyp
            clinically looks like a pyogenic granuloma
            histologically does not contain a lobular capillary hemangioma

    potentially premalignant
        actinic keratosis
            observe
        SCC in-situ
            biopsy and excise
        keratoacanthoma
            think of as pre-SCC
            treat as SCC
                incisional biopsy
                excision with margin control
        lentigo maligna melanoma
            biopsy
            excise with margins

    malignant
        incisional biopsy
            usually a 3 mm punch // in AU
        for large or aggressive lesions
            involve the GP ± oncologist
        excision with margins
            Mohs OR frozen sections
        BCC (3 mm)
            if young patient
                rule out
                    AR xeroderma pigmentosum
                    AD basal cell nevus syndrome
            BCC in the lateral canthus is a unique case
                structures near the lateral canthus
                    CN[57]
                        palsies
                        perineural tumor spread
                    lymphatics from the eyelids to the preauricular nodes
                    LCT
                    TA
                    lacrimal gland
                    eyebrow
                        can be affected by some flap closures
                    unique skin
                        canthal skin is more like eyelid skin
                        neighbouring areas don't have this type of skin
                            harder to get good flap outcomes
                    canthal angle must be reformed after surgery
                despite all these structures
                    BCC is a surgical disease
                    adjunctive therapies have a small role
                        radiation
                        imiquimod (Aldara) cream
                        5-FU (Efudix)
                assess

                    lid involvement
                    spread into the orbit
                ALWAYS: consider and document your method of margin control
                    Mohs
                    24 hour paraffin
                        requires a delay in repair until you have results
                    frozen section
                        least reliable but most convenient
                        depends on the skill of your local pathologist at reading these
                surgical repair
                    1° closure
                        best if the lesion is small enough
                        orient closure along the laugh lines
                    FTSG
                        easy
                        can cover a large area
                        color and texture aren't predictable
                        may pincushion slightly less than flaps
                            pincushioning refers to rising above the surrounding skin
                            intradermal triamcinolone can help
                    flaps
                        advancement flaps
                            Tenzel semicircular flap OR
                                too large a flap will round the canthus
                            mini Mustarde flap
                                watch out for CN7 with either of these
                                tack the flap down with at least 1 deep periosteal suture
                        rhomboid AKA Limberg flap
                        transposition flaps
                            forehead rotation Fricke flap
                            not possible to close this primarily because of the eyebrow
                                means using a less cosmetic FTSG to finish the procedure
        SCC (4 mm)
            perineural invasion of SCC can affect the orbit and cavernous sinus
            if there is a CNP associated with SCC
                scan
                    thin cut MRI ± gad of orbit and cavernous sinus
            if you can't see the whole lesion
                scan
        sebaceous cell carcinoma (4+ mm)
            very aggressive
            need workup for systemic malignancies
                Muir-Torre syndrome
                    colon CA
                    genitourinary CA
            if localized
                full-thickness excision
                need excellent margin control
            if there is pagetoid spread into the orbit
                exenteration
        malignant melanoma (5 mm)
        Kaposi sarcoma
            in immunosuppressed


lid reconstruction
    at least one of the lamellae must be local
    ladder
        1° repair (25-% of lid margin)
        1° repair with canthotomy and cantholysis
        Tenzel semicircular flap
            too large a flap will round the canthus
        upper lid:
            contralateral upper lid free tarsoconjunctival graft OR
            hard palate
            + skin-muscle flap
            more natural/mobile lid than Cutler-Beard (50+% of lid margin)
                for Cutler-Beard
                    free tarsoconjunctival graft from fellow UL
                    sew conj to the bottom of the TC graft
                    then attach skin + muscle flap tucked through full-thickness incision
                        muscle to levator
                        skin to skin
                    other option is to attach conj at the top of the defect
                        then add hard palate or similar
                        like a sandwich
        lower lid:
            adjacent tarsoconjunctival flap
            + free full-thickness skin graft
        lower lid:
            contralateral upper lid free tarsoconjunctival graft OR
            hard palate
            + skin-muscle flap
        lower lid:
            modified Hughes (50+% of lid margin)
                tarsoconjunctival flap from the upper lid
                postauricular skin graft
                cut free several weeks later
