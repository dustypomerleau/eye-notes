preseptal and orbital cellulitis:

    DDx to consider
        RARELY:
            HSV
            VZV
        lacrimal gland inflammation
            infectious
            inflammatory
            neoplastic & infiltrative
        NSOI
            diagnosis of exclusion
            default should be to biopsy
            very few situations call for empirical steroids without a diagnosis

                sight-threatening orbital apex disease
                    to temporize while you arrange biopsy
            COMMON: women
                but men are harder to treat and have more recurrences
        IgG4-ROD // much of what used to be called NSOI
            elevated eosinophils
            occlusive phlebitis

                    nearly pathognomonic if bilateral
