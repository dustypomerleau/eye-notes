TED

  COMMON: Graves disease
    nearly 1/2 of Graves patients get TED
  more common in women
  worst prognosis
    older men

  clinical course
    the Rundle curve
      dynamic phase
        gets worse over 1-2 years
        peaks and plateaus
        gradually improves over 1-2 years
      static phase
        stabilises
    effects of poorly managed TED can last a lifetime
      TALK to the patient
      tell them what to expect

  thyroid symptoms
    weight loss
    fatigue
    hair loss

  TED symptoms
    dull, deep, orbital pain
    exposure
      blurry vision
      tearing
      FB sensation
      photophobia
    ON signs
      CON
      ON stretch 2˚ proptosis

    must quit

    thyroidectomy scar
    lid retraction
      superior OR inferior

        Charlie Chaplin goes all the way girl
          Who wouldn't want Charlie Chaplin to go all the way with them?
          I mean, I certainly would.
    SLK
    proptosis
      Hertel 22+ mm OR ∆ 2+ mm
      resistance to retropulsion
    motility
      EOM restriction
        strabismus
          usually not XT
            XT should make you think of MG OR
            another missed diagnosis
          eye tends to be pulled toward most inflamed muscles
            if the orbital disease follows IMSLO
              tends to pull the eye down and medial
    compressive optic neuropathy
      colour vision
      APD
      VF constriction
        CVF
    IOP in 1˚ & upgaze
    OSD
      watch for 2˚ infections
    ON appearance
      swelling
      pallor
      evidence of glaucoma
        address CON and GON separately
        either can be present

  ancillary testing & investigations
    HVF
    non-con CT OR MRI
      fusiform enlargement
      tendon sparing
      IMSLO
    labs (90% hyperthyroid but anything is possible)
      T3
      free T4
      TSH
      TSH-R Ab
        TBII
          tests for all Ab to TSH-R
          both inhibitory and stimulating
        TSI
          tests for stimulating Ab only
          TSI is the better predictor for orbitopathy
          TSI is better for tracking treatment

            many different regimens
              500 mg q 1/52 x 6/52

              stop at 12/52 and evaluate response
            regardless of regimen
              total dose should be 8- g
            DM and HTN must be managed
              but they should not prevent you from treating TED with steroids
          ALSO: po prednisolone

            100 mg tapered 10 mg q 1/52 x 12/52 (10 mg plateau at the end)
          RARELY: orbital radiation
            combine with IVMP
            best for diplopia + restriction
            NEVER: perform OR in patients with DR OR severe HTN
              try to avoid OR even in DM without DR

  treatment

    be systematic
      make the diagnosis of TED
        prepare the patient for the typical course
      address acute issues
        optic nerve compromise
        exposure
      treat the patient's symptoms
        quit smoking
        lubrication
        systemic steroids
      treat systemic disease
        endocrine
        ± ENT
        ± psychiatry OR counselling
      once everything is quiet
        orbital surgery "Orbit is One"
        strabismus surgery
        lid surgery "Lids are Last"

    in more detail
      smoking cessation
      smoking cessation
      smoking cessation
      achieve a euthyroid state
        endocrine consult
        ± ENT consult
        ± psychiatry OR counselling
        options
          radioactive I
          thyroidectomy
          thyroid replacement
        eye disease may not track with thyroid normalisation
          still important to treat systemic disease
          counsel the patient
      lubrication
      topical cyclosporine
      lid taping
      moisture goggles
      oral steroids
        short-term
        compressive optic neuropathy
        when you mention systemic steroids in an answer
          ALWAYS: mention side effects
            counsel the patient
      IVMP
        acute optic nerve compression
      rituximab
      RARELY: EBRT
        results have not been impressive
        some centres use EBRT as an adjunct in acute ON compromise
      prism rarely helps
        max tolerance 10 ∆ V and 20+ ∆ H
      surgery
        euthyroid x 6 months
        order matters
          orbital decompression
            diplopia in 1˚
            severe proptosis despite other treatments
              cosmesis
              exposure
            stable angle for 6/12
            decompression approaches
              deep lateral
                can eliminate up to 5 mm proptosis
              balanced medial + lateral
                bigger effect
                greater risk of diplopia
              medial + lateral + floor
                can eliminate nearly 10 mm proptosis
                risk of
                  hypoglobus
                  diplopia
                  infraorbital nerve damage
          strabismus
            tables unreliable
            undercorrect
            only recessions
              COMMON: IR & MR recessions
              NEVER: do unilateral IR recession in TED
                even with adjustables results are unpredictable
                yoke muscle contracture
                  progressive overcorrection
                lower lid retraction
            use adjustables
            complications are common
              IR slippage
              LL retraction
          lids last
            tarsal switch procedure
              for LL retraction
              tarsoconjunctival graft from ipsilateral UL
      address depression and psychology
