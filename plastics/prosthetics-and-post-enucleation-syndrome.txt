orbital implants:

  cheap and low extrusion
    glass
    silicone
    PMMA

  good tissue integration and movement transfer
    hydroxyapatite
    porous polyethylene
      prevent extrusion
        cover with sclera or fascia
        close Tenon fully
        suture EOMs to sclera

  infected implant
    systemic + topical antibiotics
    removal if worsening

  exposed implant
    patch
      sclera
      fascia
    close Tenon


post-enucleation socket syndrome

  3 primary components:

    1. loss of volume
    2. lower lid laxity
    3. shortening of the fornix

    ± ptosis


  treatment:

    Is the implant large enough?
      no
        replace it
      yes
        orbital floor implant
          e.g. Medpor
          if persistent volume deficit
            dermis fat graft

    LL laxity
      LTS

    shortened fornix
      deepening sutures
        attach a silicone rod to orbital rim periosteum
        pass out through the skin

    ptosis
      new prosthesis
      still inadequate
        surgical ptosis repair

conjunctival inclusion cysts
  can occur in the anophthalmic socket
  transilluminate the cyst
    inclusion cysts will be clear
