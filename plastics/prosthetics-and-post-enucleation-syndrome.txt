orbital implants:

    cheap and low extrusion
        glass
        silicone
        PMMA

    good tissue integration and movement transfer
        hydroxyapatite
        porous polyethylene
            to prevent extrusion
                cover with sclera OR fascia
                close Tenon fully
                suture EOMs to sclera

    infected implant
        systemic + topical antibiotics
        removal if worsening

    exposed implant
        patch
            sclera
            fascia
        close Tenon


post-enucleation socket syndrome

    3 primary components:

        1. loss of volume
        2. lower lid laxity
        3. shortening of the fornix

        Â± ptosis


    treatment:

        Is the implant large enough?
            no
                replace it
            yes
                orbital floor implant
                    e.g. Medpor
                if persistent volume deficit
                    dermis fat graft

        LL laxity
            LTS

        shortened fornix
            deepening sutures
                attach a silicone rod to orbital rim periosteum
                pass out through the skin

        ptosis
            new prosthesis
            still inadequate
                surgical ptosis repair

conjunctival inclusion cysts
    can occur in the anophthalmic socket
    transilluminate the cyst
        inclusion cysts will be clear
