entropion
  involutional
  cicatricial
  spastic

  involutional
    poor snapback
    distraction 6+ mm
    disinserted LLR visible
      white line below the inferior tarsus
    LL doesn't move with downgaze
    orbicularis overrides with forced eyelid closure

    treatment must address
      horizontal laxity
      LLR disinsertion
      orbicularis override
      ± ocular surface damage from trichiasis if present

    treatment ladder
      lubrication
      BCTL
      Quickert sutures
      LTS
        ± reinsertion of LLR
        ± resection of preseptal OOM
        best outcomes use a transdermal approach
          Jones subciliary incision
      Quickert procedure

      LTS
        anesthetic to lateral canthus and LL
          go deep to the bone
        open lateral canthus
          down to orbital rim
          knife OR scissors
        expose the orbital rim
        create the strip
          cut the bottom edge of the tarsus
          make a pocket between OOM and tarsus
          cut each edge of the strip
          trim off the top edge and conjunctiva
          trim the end off the tarsal strip
        anchor it to the LOT
          double-armed 5-0 prolene
            pass it AP in the strip
            then inner to outer orbital rim
        trim the excess skin and OOM
        deep tissue 6-0 vicryl
          // to cover the prolene knot
        reform the canthal angle
          vicryl suture through the grey line
        more deep vicryls as needed
          bring the skin edges into apposition
        close the skin
          running 6-0 vicryl
        remove sutures at a week

      LLR plication
        local anesthetic
        subciliary incision
          ~ 2 mm from lashes
        dissect to tarsus
          expose the inferior border of the tarsal plate
        expose orbital septum
          visible orbital fat through septum confirms disinserted LLR
        enter septum
          good hemostasis
          dissect inferiorly to find LLR
        isolate the LLR
          ensure that the IR is not affected by your sutures
        appose the LLR to the tarsus with 6-0 vicryl
        close OOM and skin with 6-0 vicryl
        remove sutures at a week

      Quickert procedure
        mark a horizontal incision along the bottom of the tarsus
        mark a vertical incision at the center of the LL
        mark a lateral point indicating how much LL you want to resect
        infiltrate with lidocaine
        cut the lid full-thickness along the subtarsal incision
        cut the middle of the lid with scissors
          cut away the intended amount of LL using your lateral mark
        use a double-armed 6-0 vicryl to hook the LLR in 2 places
          careful not to go through the conj
        repeat with a 2nd suture laterally
        re-appose the lid margin with 6-0 vicryl
          through the tarsal plate in at least 2 locations
        6-0 vicryl through the lash line
          then close the remainder of the skin over the tarsus
        run your double-armed LLR sutures up through the OOM and out
          check that the LL now moves in downgaze
        close the skin with a running stitch
        chloramphenicol on eye and over stitches
        patch overnight
        vicryl can be left to dissolve
          probably best to remove at 2 weeks

  cicatricial
    LL resists digital eversion
    COMMON:
      history of ocular surgery
      trauma
      cicatrizing conjunctivitis
        // see cicatrizing-conjunctivitis-DDx.txt

    treatment ladder
      lubrication
      BCTL
      treat the underlying disease
        don't operate on the lids if there is active cicatrizing conjunctivitis
      tarsal fracture with everting sutures
      tarsoconjunctival or mucosal grafts
        ear cartilage
        sclera
        hard palate
      amniotic membrane grafts
      forniceal reconstruction with a silicone rod

  spastic
      ocular-irritation leads to spasm
        vicious circle
        often breaking the cycle is all that's needed
      lubrication
      BCTL
      lid taping
      Quickert sutures
      BOTOX
      surgery based on features
        LTS
          ± reinsertion of LLR
          ± resection of preseptal OOM
        Quickert procedure

  special case
    congenital entropion
      most kids have epiblepharon
      but if the lashes are abrading the cornea it's probably entropion
      they may have dysgenesis of the LLR or short posterior lamellae
      surgery
        remove skin and OOM from the subciliary region
        advance the LLR onto the tarsus

ectropion:

  involutional
  cicatricial
  paralytic
  mechanical

  involutional
    lubrication
    surgery according to features
      scarred punctum
        3-snip punctoplasty
      punctal malposition
        thermal cautery to the conjunctiva
          not favored due to high recurrence rate
        medial spindle procedure with inverting sutures
      generalized horizontal laxity
        LTS
          ± LLR reinsertion
            not commonly needed in ectropion
      MCT laxity
        distract LL laterally
        normal MCT will not allow the medial canthus to reach the limbus
        if lax
          MCT plication

    medial spindle procedure for punctal malposition
      lidocaine 2% to orbital rim, skin side, and conjunctiva
      tiny skin and OOM snip horizontally at the orbital rim
      excise conjunctival diamond below the punctum so you can access LLR
      hook the LLR with double-armed 6-0 vicryl
        aim the needle down toward the fornix
        lift the conjunctiva closest to the globe to elevate the LLR
        go posteriorly with the needle through your conj incision
        drag the LLR forward with the needle tip and then pass through
          don't pierce the conj
        repeat with the 2nd arm of the double-armed suture
        ask the patient to look up and down to ensure you have the LLR
      spiral the suture out
        catch the inferior edge of the tarsal plate and a bit of conj
          at the top of your diamond opening
          once with each arm of the suture
        pass through the conjunctiva just inferior to the diamond
          all the way out through the skin snip you made
          once with each arm of the suture
        watch the lid invert to titrate how tight you should tie the suture
      skin stitch if needed
      can be combined with other procedures like LTS

  cicatricial
    sun exposure
    eyelid neoplasm
    autoimmune disease
    radiation
    lesion excision
    Z-plasty
    full thickness skin graft

    Z-plasty
      mark your Z with the center line along ridge of greatest tension
      local anesthetic
      cut the flaps with a blade
      undermine with spring scissors to remove all tension
      place 6-0 vicryl cardinal sutures at the apices
      running vicryl to complete the skin closure

    cicatricial ectropion repair with spacer graft
      local anesthetic
      4-0 prolene traction suture through tarsal plate
      open the area of traction with a blade
        along the Langer lines
        through skin and OOM
      scissor dissection beneath OOM
        until skin moves freely
      release the traction sutures
      measure the size of the defect with mouth open and face stretched
      cut a template from plastic sheeting to match the wound
      use your template to outline the donor site
        preauricular often good
      local anesthetic to the donor site
      cut just through the skin with a blade
        avoid deep cuts near the facial nerve
      dissect graft with scissors
        take only skin
      close the donor site
        running 6-0 nylon
        a locking center bite helps with tension
      place 6-0 vicryl cardinal sutures at the graft corners
        graft-to-host
      run the 6-0 vicryl around the whole graft
      tape the lid traction sutures to the forehead
      chloramphenicol ointment
      pressure dressing over the graft
      sutures out (including vicryl) in about a week

    in AU you may hear 'tarsal' or 'marginal' ectropion
      eversion is limited to the tarsus
      can have involutional and cicatricial components
      usually a problem with LLR disinsertion

              taste from the front of the tongue
              DES from decreased lacrimal innervation
              hyperacusis
                loss of CN7 innervation to the stapedius

                bioavailability is better with valaciclovir and famciclovir
                best if started within 3 days of onset
                makes vesicles and pain resolve faster
                no impact on postherpetic neuralgia
            prednisolone 1 mg/kg/d for 1 week
