                open lateral canthus
                    down to orbital rim
                    knife OR scissors
                expose the orbital rim
                create the strip
                    cut the bottom edge of the tarsus
                    make a pocket between OOM and tarsus
                    cut each edge of the strip
                    trim off the top edge and conjunctiva
                    trim the end off the tarsal strip

                    ~ 2 mm from lashes
                dissect to tarsus
                    expose the inferior border of the tarsal plate
                expose orbital septum

                enter septum
                    good hemostasis
                    dissect inferiorly to find LLR
                isolate the LLR
                    ensure that the IR is not affected by your sutures
                appose the LLR to the tarsus with 6–0 vicryl
                close OOM and skin with 6–0 vicryl
                remove sutures at a week

            Quickert procedure
                mark a horizontal incision along the bottom of the tarsus
                mark a vertical incision at the center of the LL
                mark a lateral point indicating how much LL you want to resect
                infiltrate with lidocaine
                cut the lid full-thickness along the subtarsal incision
                cut the middle of the lid with scissors
                    cut away the intended amount of LL using your lateral mark
                use a double-armed 6–0 vicryl to hook the LLR in 2 places
                    careful not to go through the conj
                repeat with a 2nd suture laterally
                re-appose the lid margin with 6–0 vicryl
                    through the tarsal plate in at least 2 locations
                6–0 vicryl through the lash line
                    then close the remainder of the skin over the tarsus
                run your double-armed LLR sutures up through the OOM and out
                    check that the LL now moves in downgaze
                close the skin with a running stitch
                chloramphenicol on eye and over stitches
                patch overnight
                vicryl can be left to dissolve
                    probably best to remove at 2 weeks

    cicatricial

        COMMON:

                    ± resection of preseptal OOM
                Quickert procedure

    special case
        congenital entropion
            most kids have epiblepharon
            but if the lashes are abrading the cornea it's probably entropion
            they may have dysgenesis of the LLR or short posterior lamellae
            surgery
                remove skin and OOM from the subciliary region
                advance the LLR onto the tarsus

        surgery according to features
            scarred punctum
                3-snip punctoplasty
            punctal malposition
                thermal cautery to the conjunctiva
                    not favored due to high recurrence rate
                medial spindle procedure with inverting sutures
            generalized horizontal laxity
                LTS
                    ± LLR reinsertion
                        not commonly needed in ectropion
            MCT laxity
                distract LL laterally
                normal MCT will not allow the medial canthus to reach the limbus
                if lax
                    MCT plication

        medial spindle procedure for punctal malposition
            lidocaine 2% to orbital rim, skin side, and conjunctiva
            tiny skin and OOM snip horizontally at the orbital rim
            excise conjunctival diamond below the punctum so you can access LLR
            hook the LLR with double-armed 6–0 vicryl
                aim the needle down toward the fornix
                lift the conjunctiva closest to the globe to elevate the LLR
                go posteriorly with the needle through your conj incision
                drag the LLR forward with the needle tip and then pass through
                    don't pierce the conj
                repeat with the 2nd arm of the double-armed suture
                ask the patient to look up and down to ensure you have the LLR
            spiral the suture out
                catch the inferior edge of the tarsal plate and a bit of conj
                    at the top of your diamond opening
                    once with each arm of the suture
                pass through the conjunctiva just inferior to the diamond
                    all the way out through the skin snip you made
                    once with each arm of the suture
                watch the lid invert to titrate how tight you should tie the suture
            skin stitch if needed
            can be combined with other procedures like LTS

    cicatricial
        sun exposure
        eyelid neoplasm

        Z-plasty
            mark your Z with the center line along ridge of greatest tension
            local anesthetic
            cut the flaps with a blade
            undermine with spring scissors to remove all tension
            place 6–0 vicryl cardinal sutures at the apices
            running vicryl to complete the skin closure

        cicatricial ectropion repair with spacer graft
            local anesthetic
            4–0 prolene traction suture through tarsal plate
            open the area of traction with a blade
                along the Langer lines
                through skin and OOM
            scissor dissection beneath OOM
                until skin moves freely
            release the traction sutures
            measure the size of the defect with mouth open and face stretched
            cut a template from plastic sheeting to match the wound
            use your template to outline the donor site
                preauricular often good
            local anesthetic to the donor site
            cut just through the skin with a blade
                avoid deep cuts near the facial nerve
            dissect graft with scissors
                take only skin
            close the donor site
                running 6–0 nylon
                a locking center bite helps with tension
            place 6–0 vicryl cardinal sutures at the graft corners
                graft-to-host
            run the 6–0 vicryl around the whole graft
            tape the lid traction sutures to the forehead
            chloramphenicol ointment
            pressure dressing over the graft
            sutures out (including vicryl) in about a week

        you may hear the term 'tarsal' or 'marginal' ectropion
            eversion is limited to the tarsus
            can have involutional and cicatricial components
            usually a problem with LLR disinsertion

            PEE
            ulceration
        corneal sensation
        proptosis
            can inhibit closure and look like lid lag
    treatment
        lubricants
        moisture goggles
        gold weight
            0.6–1.6 g
            test by taping above the tarsus
            ideally just allows full closing but still permits opening
        tarsorrhaphy
            temporary
            permanent
        levator recession
            useful in TED
        LL LTS
            useful in CN7P
                reapposes lid
                corrects punctal malposition
        LLR recession
            ± cartilage OR palate spacer
            to raise LL if exposure is refractory

floppy eyelid syndrome
    spontaneous eversion with traction
        distraction test
    ± eyelid imbrication
    horizontal laxity
        punctum can be pulled past the limbus
    papillary reaction
        usually upper tarsus
    ocular surface disease
    OSA
    DM
    keratoconus
    treatment
        lubricate
        ALWAYS: sleep study
        weight loss if obese
        wedge resection better than LTS
            usually resect at inner 1/3 junction
                avoid the canaliculus
            avoid lateral lid
                risks lacrimal gland injury
        MCT laxity may need plication

giant fornix syndrome
    COMMON: elderly females
    chronic purulent conjunctivitis
    progressive toxic keratopathy
        late NVK
    large and deep upper fornix
    Staph. aureus colonising a yellow protein coagulum
    intensive topical antibiotics + steroids
        ± systemic antibiotics
    may need long-term maintenance steroids and antibiotics
