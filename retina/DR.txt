antiVEGF in PDR
  DRCR-S (2015)
    305 patients with PDR
      nearly 1/3 participated with both eyes
        1 eye got PRP
        fellow eye got Lucentis
          Does this make PRP look better than it should?
          consider fellow eye effect
    2 groups
      PRP over 1–3 visits
      Lucentis q 4 weeks x 3 OR until NV resolved, then prn
        treated for visible NV on exam or photos
        rescue PRP allowed at the investigator's discretion
          treatment 'failure' or 'futility'
      both groups were allowed prn Lucentis for DME (!)
        VA 6/9- AND CST 2 SDs thicker than gender and age-matched controls
        1/2 of the PRP group got Lucentis for DME over 2 years (!)
      macular laser was allowed at the investigator's discretion
    VA outcomes were similar
      remember this study is not primarily a DME study, but a PDR study
    RD
      PRP 10%
      Lucentis 6%
    PPV
      PRP 15%
      Lucentis 4%
    numbers for NVI, NVG, VH were low and similar between groups
    1/2 of the Lucentis group improved 2+ steps on the DRSS (!)
  CLARITY (2017)
    232 UK NHS patients
    randomized
      baseline PRP
      baseline Eylea q 4 weeks x 3 and then prn active NV
    previous injections were allowed
    1˚ outcome: ETDRS BCVA
      Eylea was superior to PRP by 4 letters over 1 year with strong stats
    2˚ outcomes:
      Pelli Robson contrast sensitivity
        no difference between the groups
      low-luminance VA
        no difference between the groups
      number of missed points on Esterman VF
        PRP group did much worse
          confirms that PRP causes meaningful VF loss
      DME by OCT and FFA
        only a couple patients developed DME
        both in the PRP group
    mean of 4–5 injections in the Eylea group
      similar numbers when comparing untreated to previously treated patients

      make of this what you will but it's not overwhelming
    DRCR data suggests that some patients may respond late
      persistent DME in
        76% @ 4 weeks -> 42% @ 24 weeks
        post hoc analysis // 2018 publication
          twice as many Avastin patients had persistent DME at 24 weeks
          since fewer Eylea patients had persistent DME
            it makes sense to switch persistent cases
            but we don't actually have head-to-head switch data
      they suggest treating everyone with at least 6 x 4-weekly injections
      but keep in mind
        measurable response + refractory edema ≠ no measurable response
        usually you will see some objective effect
          even if the vision is not yet improving
    expectations
      all agents combined
        2/3 gain 10+ letters over 2 years
        1/3 stay the same (only 2–3% lose vision despite treatment)
  DRCR-U
    116 patients with persistent DME despite 3+ Lucentis injections
    randomized
      Lucentis only

        different cutoffs depending on age + sex
      fairly aggressive criteria
        we can assume most patients were treated
    weeks 12–20
      the Ozurdex group could be retreated a 2nd time
      same criteria as antiVEGF
    1˚ outcome was ∆ VA over 24 weeks
    Ozurdex patients did no better than Lucentis alone
      OCT was thinner but ∆ VA was similar
      1/4 Ozurdex patients had a 10+ mm Hg IOP spike
      0 Lucentis only patients had an IOP spike
      follow-up was too short for much comment on cataract
        3 patients in the Ozurdex group had CEIOL right after the study

asymmetric DR
  Gay and Rosenbaum (1966) found carotid stenosis was protective against DR
    this has *never* been consistently replicated and is probably false
    actually it wasn't even carotid stenosis
      ophthalmodynamometry was performed on 10 patients
    10/250 patients assessed had 2+ 'stages' of difference in DR
      classification was Ballantyne (1946)
        remember this predates the DRS
        stages 3–5 are all PDR (!)

/*
"Based upon the retinal changes in 178 diabetics, BALLANTYNE (1946) divided
the retinopathy into 5 stages according to their relation to the development
of retinopathy. The first stage included microaneurysms with or without
punctate hemorrhages and punctate exudates. The second, dot and blot
hemorrhages and waxy exudates. The third, periphlebitis and phlebosclerosis,
new-formed intra and preretinal vessels, increasing hemorrhages in the retina
and vitreous, massive exudates, retinitis proliferans and detachment of the
retina. The fourth, further advance in vessel changes, increase in vitreous
hemorrhage and exudates, destruction of the retina. The fifth, a  mixed form,
included most of the above-mentioned changes and hypertensive changes."

or from the Gay paper itself
  1. Microaneurysms, minute hemorrhages, and punctate exudates.
  2. Dot and blot hemorrhages, waxy exudates either discrete or confluent.
  3. Retinal hemorrhages, irregular expansion of veins, formation of knobs,
  loops, coils, and leashes ; newly formed intraretinal and preretinal
  plexuses; vascular tufts in the vitreous.
  4. Intraocular hemorrhage ; retinitis proliferans, detachment of retina and
  vitreous, secondary glaucoma.

      DRS high risk PDR with < preproliferative in the fellow eye
        defined as CWS only!
        VB and IRMA were deemed 'too dificult to quantify'
      so carotid doppler was performed on only patients with
        PDR in one eye
        no PDR in the fellow eye
        no CWS in the fellow eye
    387 patients over 2 years
    20/387 patients had asymmetric DR
      these 20 patients had carotid dopplers
    4/20 had hemodynamically significant carotid stenosis
      defined as 75+% occlusion
      2/4 had ipsilateral stenosis
      2/4 had contralateral stenosis
    concluded that carotid stenosis was not protective
  Dogru (1998)
    asymmetry was defined as PDR in 1 eye only for 2+ years
      so SNPDR/PDR was considered asymmetric
    19 patients were evaluated over 7 years (denominator?)
    5/19 patients with delayed arm to retina time on FFA
      delayed arm to retina time is not defined
      ONLY these patients had carotid studies
        all 5 had 90+% ipsilateral carotid stenosis
          by doppler OR carotid angiogram
      low perfusion pressure on the ipsilateral side was confirmed by ODM
        technique not described
        low perfusion pressure by ODM is not defined
    the other 14/19 patients
      protective
        PVD
          some in the setting of AH
          AH by itself had no bearing beyond absence of PVD
        optic atrophy
          AION
          blunt trauma
        high myopia
    only 2 factors were statistically significant
      ipsilateral carotid occlusion
      no PVD
  /*
  At a minimum, you should be skeptical of claims that carotid stenosis is
  protective against DR. Unfortunately, for exam purposes, you will still need
  to say this.

cataract surgery in DR
  for any DR patient
    ALWAYS:
      involve the GP
      consider systemic control
  postop complications
    worsening PDR
      NVI
      NVG
      TRD
    DME
    CME
      petalloid
      360
      disc staining
      OCT usually HFL
        but DME can be here also
    endophthalmitis
  preop
    GP evaluation
    counseling
      DM control
      surgical risks as above
    biometry
      can be challenging
        PSC
        VH
        TRD
    in PDR
      maximize PRP
        preop slitlamp
        intraop indirect
    pretreat
      topical steroids
      NSAIDs
    surgical timing
      consider the state of the fellow eye
      operate more urgently for "only eye" situations
  intraop
    large CCC
      high risk of ACCS
    monofocal acrylic lens
      may need SO later
    meticulous LEC cleanup
    suture the wound
  postop
    always use NSAIDs

      earlier
      more often
