wavelengths for retinal imaging

//... a stub for future expansion

    fluorescein molecule
        peak excitation 480–490
        peak transmission 520–530

    ICG molecule
        peak excitation 805
        peak transmission 835

    Spectralis
        OCT 870
        IR
            excite 820 (SLO laser)
            no filter?
                // sensor can be adjusted in software to achieve a filter-like effect
                // "no filter" might not mean the same as it did in the analog days
        BR
            excite 488
            no filter?
        BAF
            excite 488
            521- wide BP filter
        ICG
            excite 790
            filter?
        FFA
            excite 488
            filter?
        acquisition focus
            for Spectralis modalities that are blue-dominated
                such as
                    false multicolor
                    BR
                    BAF
                    FFA
                defocus -0.5 to -1 D
            for Spectralis modalities that are red-dominated
                such as
                    IR
                    OCT
                    ICG
                place the image in focus

    fundus camera
        red-free
            excite with white light OR
            excite with 535–585 exciter filter for FAF if you have it
            530–560 BP filter
                analog film through a BP filter
                monochrome digital sensor
                full-color digital sensor through a BP filter
                full-color digital sensor set to monochrome mode in software
                    does not use a filter
                    not quite the same quality but convenient
                full-color digital images with RGB channels separated in software
                    lower resolution
                        only 1/3 pixels devoted to G channel
                // similar options exist for FFA, FAF, ICG
        FFA
            excite 490
            530–560 BP filter
        FAF
            excite 535–585
            605–715 BP filter
        ICG // not sure of exact wavelengths for any given product
            excite ~ 805
            BP filter centered ~ 835

FFA times
    choroidal flush
        ~ 10 seconds
    cilioretinal artery filling
    arterial phase AKA arm-to-retina time
        ~ 2 seconds after choroidal flush
        ~ 12 seconds total
    AV phase AKA laminar flow
        ~ 15 seconds
    venous phase
        veins completely full
        ~ 20 seconds
        vessels are at their brightest
        ~ 30 seconds
    mid-phase AKA recirculation phase
        ~ 2–4 minutes
        veins and arteries roughly equal in brightness
        slow fade in all tissues
        many docs will call these images "lates"
    late phase
        ~ 7 to 15 minutes
        gradual elimination of dye
        disc staining this late is normal

SDOCT
    reflected infrared laser
        // see above
    split into a spectrum of frequencies by dispersive element
    spectrum falls on a detector of photosensitive diodes
    Fourier transform
        calculates the depth of tissue from which the reflected spectra originate
    SNR falls off dramatically as you move away from the zero-delay line
