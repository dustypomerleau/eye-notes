wavelengths for retinal imaging

// work in progress - still some unanswered questions

  fluorescein molecule
    peak excitation 480-490
    peak transmission 520-530

  ICG molecule
    peak excitation 805
    peak transmission 835

  Spectralis
    OCT 870
    IR
      excite 820 (SLO laser)
      no filter?
        // sensor can be adjusted in software to achieve a filter-like effect
        // "no filter" might not mean the same as it did in the analog days
        // buy one of the Heidelberg engineers a beer and work this out
    BR
      excite 488
      no filter?
    FAF
      excite 488
      521- wide BP filter
    ICG
      excite 790
      filter?
    FFA
      excite 488
      filter?

  fundus camera
    red-free
      excite with white light ||
      excite with 535-585 exciter filter for FAF if you have it
      530-560 BP filter
        analog film through a BP filter
        monochrome digital sensor
        full-color digital sensor through a BP filter
        full-color digital sensor set to monochrome mode in software
          does not use a filter
          not quite the same quality but convenient
        full-color digital images with RGB channels separated in software
          lower resolution
            only 1/3 pixels devoted to G channel
        // similar options exist for FFA, FAF, ICG
    FFA
      excite 490
      530-560 BP filter
    FAF
      excite 535-585
      605-715 BP filter
    ICG // not sure of exact wavelengths for any given product
      excite ~ 805
      BP filter centred ~ 835

FFA times
  choroidal flush
    ~ 10 seconds
  cilioretinal artery filling
  arterial phase AKA arm-to-retina time
    ~ 2 seconds after choroidal flush
    ~ 12 seconds total
  AV phase AKA laminar flow
    ~ 15 seconds
  venous phase
    veins completely full
    ~ 20 seconds
    vessels are at their brightest
    ~ 30 seconds
  mid-phase AKA recirculation phase
    ~ 2-4 minutes
    veins and arteries roughly equal in brightness
    slow fade in all tissues
    many docs will call these images "lates"
  late phase
    ~ 7 to 15 minutes
    gradual elimination of dye
    disc staining this late is normal


//


SDOCT
  reflected infrared laser
    // see wavelengths-for-retinal-imaging.txt
  split into a spectrum of frequencies by dispersive element
  spectrum falls on a detector of photosensitive diodes
  Fourier transform
    calculates the depth of tissue from which the reflected spectra originate
  SNR falls off dramatically as you move away from the zero-delay line
