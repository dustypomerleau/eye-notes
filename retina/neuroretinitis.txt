neuroretinitis
  probably more accurate to say ODEMS // optic disc edema with a macular star
    the macular star is really a 2° effect of disc swelling
    but neuroretinitis is the most recognized term
      some suggest using neuroretinitis only for infectious causes
        but none of your colleagues will adhere to this
  COMMON: unilateral
    3/4 of cases
    RAPD often present
  1/2 report viral prodrome
  macular star takes 1–2 weeks to develop
    see your disc swelling patients back in a week
  COMMON: vitreous cells
    90%

NR shortlist
  Bartonella
  Bartonella
  Bartonella
    2/3 of NR cases are Bartonella
    under 50
    may have a mild RAPD
    3/4 have systemic symptoms
    treatment does not improve final VA
      azithromycin
        500 mg po daily x 1 day OR 10 mg/kg for 45- kg
        250 mg po daily x 4 days OR 5 mg/kg for 45- kg
      doxycycline + rifampicin have also been used
    usually still treat if
      immunosuppressed
      systemic symptoms
    prognosis
      most of the vision loss is from the CME rather than the nerve
      final VA is 6/12 or better in 90+%
  TB
  syphilis
  Lyme
  DUSN
  IRVAN
  idiopathic
    sometimes still called LISN
      even though some of Leber's 1916 cases would not be idiopathic today
    URI prodrome is common
      probably an undiscovered viral cause
