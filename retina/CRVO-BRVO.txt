RVO

    CRVO risk factors
        age
        metabolic syndrome
            obesity
            HTN
            DM
            hyperlipidemia
        atherosclerosis
        CVA
        hyperviscosity syndromes
        thrombophilias
        smoking
        uveitis
        vasculitis
        OHTN
        glaucoma
        ocular compression
            orbital mass

        BRVO risk factors
            much less established
            likely include
                metabolic syndrome
                atherosclerosis
            may not include
                CRVO ocular risk factors

    early CRVO may have very subtle findings
        DCP provides most of the venous drainage
        high venous pressure -> 2° DCP ischemia -> perivenular 'fern-like' PAMM

treatment
    antiVEGF
        most do treat and extend
        choice of agent
            NEWTON study
                1 year results at ASRS 2016 (Khurana)
                20 patients previously treated with Lucentis or Avastin
                unable to extend beyond monthly
                switched to Eylea
                mean interval between injections increased from 6–10 weeks
                90+% went longer on Eylea
        PBS VA criteria for Eylea and Lucentis initial RVO therapy // AU only
            BRVO
                6/120–6/12
            CRVO
                6/96–6/12
    steroids
        //...
        Triesence
        Ozurdex
        Zuprata
            suprachoroidal triamcinolone
            Zuprata + Eylea has finished phase 2
                reduced Eylea injection burden
            thought to have lower risk of IOP spikes
                wait for phase 3
    laser
        //...
        BRAVO + CRUISE
            scatter to NP does not reduce injections for CME
                similar data for DME in other studies
                BROADLY: scatter only for NV ± VH


//


when you see a posterior segment with PDR OR RVO
    ALWAYS: consider the risk of NVG
