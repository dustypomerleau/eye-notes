    BRVO risk factors
      much less established
      likely include
        metabolic syndrome
        atherosclerosis
      may not include
        CRVO ocular risk factors

  treatment
    antiVEGF
      most do treat and extend
      choice of agent
        NEWTON study
          1 year results at ASRS 2016 (Khurana)
          20 patients previously treated with Lucentis or Avastin
          unable to extend beyond monthly
          switched to Eylea
          mean interval between injections increased from 6-10 weeks
          90+% went longer on Eylea
    steroids
      //...
      Triesence
      Ozurdex
      Zuprata
        suprachoroidal triamcinolone
        Zuprata + Eylea has finished phase 2
          reduced Eylea injection burden
        thought to have lower risk of IOP spikes
          wait for phase 3
    laser
      //...
      BRAVO + CRUISE
        scatter to NP does not reduce injections for CME
          similar data for DME in other studies
          BROADLY: scatter only for NV ± VH

when you see a posterior segment with PDR OR RVO
  ALWAYS: consider the risk of NVG
