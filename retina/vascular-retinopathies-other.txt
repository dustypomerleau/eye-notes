          ...
  treatment
    spironolactone 25 mg daily
    eplerenone 25 mg x 1 week then 50 mg x 4 weeks
    rifampin 10 mg/kg up to 600 mg total daily dose (i.e. up to 300 bd)
      upregulates CYP450
        warfarin and other drugs metabolized more rapidly
        INR will drop
    finasteride
    mifepristone
    thermal laser
    PDT

PCV
  SHRM overlying a PED
    suggestive of polyp OR CNV
  branching vascular network
    often feeds into PCV
  laser OR PDT
    30% bleed rate

venous dilation as you move away from the disc margin
  generic sign of widespread retinal ischemia
  look for this
    DM
    RVO
    ...

OIS
  some patients have pain
    dull orbital ache
  vision loss
    usually gradual
    can have amaurosis
    poor light adaptation

  FFA
    delayed choroidal filling
      normal ~ 10 seconds
      choroidal filling is usually normal in RVO or DR
    long AV transit time
      laminar flow should start ~ 15 seconds
      veins should fill completely ~ 30 seconds
    NV if present
  PRP if NV
  ESR
    rule out GCA
  carotid ultrasound
    OIS generally requires 90+% stenosis
    NASCET
      CEA for 70-99% stenosis
