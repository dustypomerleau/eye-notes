ERG interpretation

        most ERGs are done dilated

                better definition of peak time
                better distinction of negative waveforms with very little b-wave
                better OPs
                better results with media opacity
                major difference is a larger amplitude a-wave
                    this also results in a larger b-wave
                    remember the b-wave is measured from the a-wave trough

                not good for ruling out ON disease
                    only 1/2 of optic neuropathies will show an abormal PERG
                        usually an increase in N95 peak time

                    ganglion cells
                    decreased N95/P50 is typical of compressive ON
            compare with VEP
                increase in P100 peak time supports ON disease
                normal P100 peak time + delayed PERG is usually retinal disease

        MFERG
