          rod recovery is limited to 20- Hz
    ERG technique
      most modern machines are LED-based
      all tests use a 300 Hz low-pass filter
      30 minutes dark adaptation
      dark-adapted 0.01 cd•s/m2 rod ERG
        rod-driven response of 'on' bipolar cells

      dark-adapted 3 cd•s/m2 OPs
        amacrine cells
        not always recorded separately
        can be derived from the 3 cd•s/m2 ERG using a 75 Hz high-pass filter
        look for 3 main positive peaks ± a 4th small peak
          interpretation beyond noting presence or absence is much debated

      dark-adapted 10 cd•s/m2 ERG
        not always done
        better definition of peak time
        better distinction of negative waveforms with very little b-wave
        better OPs
        better results with media opacity
        major difference is a larger amplitude a-wave
          this also results in a larger b-wave
          remember the b-wave is measured from the a-wave trough
      light-adapted 3 cd•s/m2 cone ERG

        optic neuritis
        hereditary optic neuropathies
        ON drusen
        compressive ON
        macular versus ON cases
          to determine which is causing the bulk of the vision loss
        not good for ruling out ON disease
          only 1/2 of optic neuropathies will show an abormal PERG
            usually an increase in N95 peak time
      peaks are named by average peak time
        N35
        P50
          amacrine cells
          RARELY: decreased
            very poor visual prognosis
        N95 // 9 looks like the g in ganglion
          ganglion cells
          decreased N95/P50 is typical of compressive ON
      compare with VEP
        increase in P100 peak time supports ON disease
        normal P100 peak time + delayed PERG is usually retinal disease

    MFERG
      requires good fixation
        an unreliable patient renders the test useless
      only good for cone responses
      hydroxychloroquine
      macular dystrophies
      hexagonal pattern changing @ 75 Hz across central 50˚
      N1
        analogous to a-wave in terms of involved cells
      P1
      N2
        together P1 and N2 contain contributions from cells causing
