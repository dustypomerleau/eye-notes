ROP

  etiology
    increased O2 exposure in the setting of incomplete retinal vascularization
    2° vasoconstriction
    VEGF
    NV
    TRD

  stages
    1 - line
    2 - ridge
    3 - NV
    4 - RD
      4B involves the macula
    5 - total RD
    ± plus disease according to a standard photo of the posterior pole

  zones
    centered on ON
    1 - 2 * (ON to fovea)
    2 - zone 1 to the nasal ora
    3 - temporal crescent

  threshold disease
    5 contiguous OR 8 noncontiguous CH stage 3+
    in zone 1 or 2
    no longer used for treatment
      but still occasionally appears on exams

  treatment criteria
    based on ETROP
    diode laser to the ora is still standard of care
      zone 1
        any +
        3-
      zone 2
        2+
        3+

  screening:
    1500- g OR 32- weeks
    start at 32 weeks GA
    zone 1 but no ROP
      follow every 2 weeks
    zone 1 + ROP
      follow weekly
    zone 2 + ROP
      follow weekly for stage 3 ROP
      otherwise follow every 2 weeks
    more detailed criteria for screening
      G-ROP study of CHOP ROP criteria (2017)
        main criteria
          birth weight (g)
          daily weight gain (g/d)
          gestational age (weeks)
        requires a logistic regression formula
          examine infants with probability 0.014+
        nomograms are available which approximate this
        not popular in practice due to complexity
