Gass macular hole stages

    * Stage 1a: Foveal detachment. Macular cyst. Tangential vitreous traction
    results in the elevation of the fovea marked by increased clinical
    prominence of xanthophyll pigment.  This stage is occasionally referred to
    as the yellow dot stage and can also be seen in cases of central serous
    chorioretinopathy, cystoid macular edema, and solar retinopathy.

    * Stage 1b: As the foveal retina elevates to the level of the perifoveal,
    the yellow dot of xanthophyll pigment changes to a donut shaped yellow ring.
    Persistent traction on the fovea leads to dehiscence of deeper retinal
    layers at the umbo.

    * Stage 2: This is the first stage when a full-thickness break in the retina
    exists.  It is defined as a full-thickness macular hole less than 400 µm in
    size. The full-thickness defect may appear eccentric, and there may be a
    pseudo-operculum at this stage if there has been spontaneous vitreofoveolar
    separation. These opercula have been examined and found to be vitreous
    condensation and glial proliferation without harboring any retinal tissue.

    * Stage 3: A full-thickness macular hole in the retina exists. It is greater
    than 400 µm in size and is still with partial vitreomacular adhesion/
    traction.

    * Stage 4: A full-thickness macular hole exists in the presence of a
    complete separation of the vitreous from the macula and the optic disc.
    There is recent evidence, however, that, even in the presence of an apparent
    posterior vitreous detachment, a thin shell of residual cortical vitreous
    may still remain and contribute to the macular hole.
