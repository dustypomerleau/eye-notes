Gass macular hole stages are described below.

    * Stage 1a: Foveal detachment. Macular cyst. Tangential vitreous traction results in the elevation of the fovea marked by increased clinical prominence of xanthophyll pigment.  This stage is occasionally referred to as the yellow dot stage and can also be seen in cases of central serous chorioretinopathy, cystoid macular edema, and solar retinopathy.
    
    * Stage 1b: As the foveal retina elevates to the level of the perifoveal, the yellow dot of xanthophyll pigment changes to a donut shaped yellow ring. Persistent traction on the fovea leads to dehiscence of deeper retinal layers at the umbo. 
    
    * Stage 2: This is the first stage when a full-thickness break in the retina exists.  It is defined as a full-thickness macular hole less than 400 µm in size. The full-thickness defect may appear eccentric, and there may be a pseudo-operculum at this stage if there has been spontaneous vitreofoveolar separation. These opercula have been examined and found to be vitreous condensation and glial proliferation without harboring any retinal tissue.
    
    * Stage 3: A full-thickness macular hole in the retina exists. It is greater than 400 µm in size and is still with partial vitreomacular adhesion/traction.
    
    * Stage 4: A full-thickness macular hole exists in the presence of a complete separation of the vitreous from the macula and the optic disc. There is recent evidence, however, that, even in the presence of an apparent posterior vitreous detachment, a thin shell of residual cortical vitreous may still remain and contribute to the macular hole.
