                    presumed melanoma
                probably treat
                ultimately clinician judgement based on full picture

combined hamartoma of the retina and RPE
    associations
        NF2
    diagnosis
        may have a vascular component
            vascular tortuosity is out of proportion to traction
            FFA helps to distinguish from melanocytoma
        glial component is rarely seen in melanocytoma
    treatment
        observe
        you can't peel the 'ERM' because it isn't an ERM
            the glial tissue is integrated with the retina

subretinal infiltrates in a leopard skin pattern
    lymphoma // see chorioretinitis.txt

choroidal mets
    leopard spot pigment clumping pattern
        don't confuse this with the lymphoma pattern
            an unfortunate coincidence in terminology
        one is light and one is dark
        one is a reticular pattern and one is the spots themselves

choroidal folds
    THIN RPE
        tumors
        hypotony
        inflammation
        idiopathic

choroidal osteoma
    usually PP
    orange-red -> yellow white as overlying RPE loses pigment
    look for small vascular networks on the tumor surface
    BSUS

choroidal granuloma
    COMMON:
        TB
        sarcoid
            if there is a choroidal granuloma
                the incidence of neurosarcoid is doubled

                large hyporeflective spaces
                not specific to any one cause of granuloma
            ALSO:
                subretinal granulomas
                    consolidate with treatment

torpedo maculopathy
    many alternative names
        solitary hypopigmented nevus
        amelanotic nevus
        hypomelanotic nevus
        albinotic nevus
        solitary amelanotic spot
        hypomelanotic freckle
        paramacular coloboma
            NOTE: torpedo is not really a coloboma in any sense
    congenital
    COMMON: temporal macula
    RPE lacks pigment
        may be pigmented at the edges
    very well circumscribed
        like CHRPE
            but the overlying retina is minimally affected
            some PR disruption is possible
    COMMON: asymptomatic
    RARELY: scotomas
    OCT
        mild transmission
        ±
            mild PR disruption
            OR thinning
            OR cavitation
            inner retina should be continuous over the lesion
                AOT a coloboma
