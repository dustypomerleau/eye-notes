congenital vascular malformations of the retina and choroid

    retinal lesions

        retinal capillary hemangioma AKA retinal hemangioblastoma
            sporadic OR (AD (VP) + VHL)
            VHL may have
                CNS hemangioblastomas
                cysts
                    pancreatic
                    renal
                pheochromocytoma
                renal cell carcinoma
            ALWAYS: MRI
                belly
                brain
                orbits
            treatment based on size
                small lesions
                    thermal laser
                medium lesions
                    cryo
                large lesions
                    radiation

        sporadic racemose hemangiomatosis AKA Wyburn Mason syndrome
            AV communications lead to dilated and tortuous retinal vessels
            may have vision loss from other AVMs along the visual pathway
                ALWAYS: MRI
                    brain
                    orbits
            RARELY: facial lesions
                similar to Sturge Weber PWS
            usually no treatment

        sporadic OR AD (VP) retinal cavernous hemangioma
            inner retinal aneurysms and gliosis
            COMMON: asymptomatic
            NOTE:
                vessels don't leak
                    so no exudation
            ALWAYS: MRI for associated cerebral aneurysms
            usually no treatment

    choroidal lesions

        sporadic circumscribed choroidal hemangioma
            COMMON: cavernous
            ALSO: mixed capillary + cavernous
            RARELY: capillary
            BSUS
                high IR
                    may have osseous metaplasia
            if symptomatic
                treatment ladder
                    PDT
                    TTT
                    radiation

        sporadic diffuse choroidal hemangioma
            COMMON:
                Sturge Weber syndrome
                mixed capillary + cavernous
            BSUS
                high IR
                    may have osseous metaplasia
            COMMON: leptomeningeal angiomas
                ALWAYS: MRI brain
            poor visual prognosis
            treatment
                COMMON: none
                RARELY:
                    radiation
                        to prevent exudative RD
                    PDT
                        when the active region is small

NOTE:
    circumscribed choroidal hemangioma is the only lesion you don't need to MRI
