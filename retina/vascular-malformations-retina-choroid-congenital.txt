congenital vascular malformations of the retina and choroid

  retinal lesions

    retinal capillary hemangioma AKA retinal hemangioblastoma
      sporadic OR (AD (VP) + VHL)
      VHL may have
        CNS hemangioblastomas
        cysts
          pancreatic
          renal
        pheochromocytoma
        renal cell carcinoma
      ALWAYS: MRI
        belly
        brain
        orbits
      treatment based on size
        small lesions
          thermal laser
        medium lesions
          cryo
        large lesions
          radiation

    sporadic racemose hemangiomatosis AKA Wyburn Mason syndrome
      AV communications lead to dilated and tortuous retinal vessels
      may have vision loss from other AVMs along the visual pathway
        ALWAYS: MRI
          brain
          orbits
      RARELY: facial lesions
        similar to Sturge Weber PWS
      usually no treatment

    sporadic OR AD (VP) retinal cavernous hemangioma
      inner retinal aneurysms and gliosis
      COMMON: asymptomatic
      NOTE:
        vessels don't leak
          so no exudation
      ALWAYS: MRI for associated cerebral aneurysms
      usually no treatment

  choroidal lesions

    sporadic circumscribed choroidal hemangioma
      COMMON: cavernous
      ALSO: mixed capillary + cavernous
      RARELY: capillary
      BSUS
        high IR
          may have osseous metaplasia
      if symptomatic
        treatment ladder
          PDT
          TTT
          radiation

    sporadic diffuse choroidal hemangioma
      COMMON:
        Sturge Weber syndrome
        mixed capillary + cavernous
      BSUS
        high IR
          may have osseous metaplasia
      COMMON: leptomeningeal angiomas
        ALWAYS: MRI brain
      poor visual prognosis
      treatment
        COMMON: none
        RARELY:
          radiation
            to prevent exudative RD
          PDT
            when the active region is small

NOTE:
  circumscribed choroidal hemangioma is the only lesion you don't need to MRI
