IOFB

    essential history
        mechanism
            high velocity
                machinery
                metal-on-metal
                more likely to have small IOFB that are hard to detect
        composition
            most inflammatory
                pure aluminum
                copper
                iron
                zinc
            chronic inflammation
                copper alloys 85-% elemental copper
                    brass
                    bronze
                    chronic chalcosis
                        Wilson-like peripheral Descemet deposition
                        sunflower cataract
                        metallic ILM flecks
                iron
                    chronic siderosis
                        oxidative damage
                            iris
                                heterochromia
                            lens
                                cataract
                            retina
                                RAPD
                                ON pallor
                                pigmentary retinopathy
                                reduced ERG b-wave
                            RPE
        how recent?
        risk factors for endophthalmities after PEI
            rural location
            disruption of the lens
                effectively a unicameral eye
                lens protein may nourish bacteria
            tissue prolapse
            organic IOFB
            delayed primary closure
                24+ hours means 4x greater risk of infection

    ocular trauma scoring
        include all of these in your documentation
            can't score unless you've documented all factors
        lose points for
            RAPD (-10)
            RRD (-11)
            perforation (-14) // sharp
            endophthalmitis (-17)
            rupture (-23) // blunt
        gain points for
            VA
                NPL (+60)

            91- (4)
            92+ (5)
            1 is the worst prognosis
                3/4 NPL
            5 is the best prognosis
                nearly all 6/12+

    essential decision points
        lens and capsule status
        retinal status
        infection versus sterile inflammation

    surgical timing
        1–3 weeks probably best
        too early
            clot not liquefied
        too late
            socked in and fibrosed
        indications for early PPV
            poor VA in fellow eye
            corneal decompensation
            torn lens capsule
                cataract with intact capsule may benefit from delay
                    to get proper biometry
            endophthalmitis
                sterile OR
                infectious
                    Bacillus spp.
                    GPC
                    fungal
            VH precluding adequate assessment of the retina
            ambiguous BSUS findings
            mac-on RRD OR
            progressive VR traction

    IOFB is a subset of PEI
        observe TICS
            tetanus
            IV antibiotics
                IV vancomycin + ceftazidime 1 g each q 12 hours OR
                a 4th generation quinolone such as IV moxifloxacin OR
                po cipro 500–750 mg bd x 7–10 days // common AU protocol
                ± voriconazole 200 mg IV OR po q 12 hours
            CT scan
                IOFB
                bony fractures
                orbital compartment syndrome
            shield

    removal technique
        via PP OR
        tunneled CS incision
            rare-earth magnet
            FB forceps

    prophylactic antibiotics
        consider in every case
        ALWAYS: use antibiotics in PEI cases with organic matter
            vancomycin
            ceftazidime
            ± amphotericin B

    monitor the fellow eye for SO
    leave corneal sutures in ~ 3 months

    if any question of retained iron
        serial ERGs
