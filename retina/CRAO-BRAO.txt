        embolic
            atherosclerosis
                COMMON: carotid
            valvular
            atrial myxoma
        inflammatory
            inflammatory
                sarcoid
            autoimmune
                lupus
            vasculitis
                GCA
        thrombotic
            hypercoagulable states // see CRVO-BRVO.txt
            sickle cell disease
            disc drusen
            arterial loops
        traumatic

    ancillary tests
        none are essential
        consider
            OCT
            FFA
                delayed RV filling and transit time
                choroidal filling should be normal
                    if delayed
                        consider ophthalmic artery OR carotid occlusion

    investigations
        BP
        cholesterol
        ECG
        ALWAYS: carotid US
        TTE
        ESR
            old patients
            no obvious emboli
        hypercoagulable workup // see CRVO-BRVO.txt
            when indicated
        don't delay
            highest risk of stroke is in the first 1 week

    gonio @ 1 month for NVI
        1-/5 cases

    treatment // none widely accepted
        in transit to the ophthalmologist
            hyperventilation into a bag
                reduced CO2 causes vasodilation
        aqueous suppressants
        Diamox
        AC paracentesis
        hyperbaric oxygen
