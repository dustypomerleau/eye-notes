AMD
    high IR iron levels may generate more free radicals
        some doctors recommend avoiding supplements with iron in AMD patients
        AREDS2 vitamins increase iron absorption
            avoid in iron storage diseases
                hemochromatosis
    SDD
        COMMON: associated with RAP lesions
        5 times as likely to progress to GA
        1-2 times as likely to progress to CNV
            AREDS2 data
                found no increased risk of CNV with SDD
                controlling for fellow eye CNV eliminated the perceived increase

Does antiVEGF therapy promote GA?
    NOTE: no true control exists for this question
        unless we are willing not to treat
        unclear if GA in treated CNV is the same as GA alone

/*
In general, parametric regression / GLM assume that the relationship between
the Y variable and each X variable is linear, that the residuals once you've
fitted the model follow a normal distribution and that the size of the
residuals stays about the same all the way along your fitted line(s). When
your data don't conform to these assumptions, transformations can help.

It should be intuitive that if Y is proportional to X2 then square-rooting Y
linearises this relationship, leading to a model that better fits the
assumptions and that explains more variance (has higher R2). Square rooting Y
also helps when you have the problem that the size of your residuals
progressively increases as your values of X increase (i.e. the scatter of data
points around the fitted line gets more marked as you move along it). Think of
the shape of a square root function: it increases steeply at first but then
saturates. So applying a square root transform inflates smaller numbers but
stabilises bigger ones. So you can think of it as pushing small residuals at
low X values away from the fitted line and squishing large residuals at high X
values towards the line. (This is mental shorthand not proper math!)
