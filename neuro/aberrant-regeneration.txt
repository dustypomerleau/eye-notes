aberrant regeneration

    aberrent regeneration of CN7
        usually after Bell palsy
            tears with cheek puffing AKA crocodile tears
                BOTOX
            ptosis with cheek puffing
                excess OOM tone

    aberrant regeneration of CN3 after CN3P
        lid elevation in downgaze AKA lid-gaze dyskinesis
        pupil constriction with eye movement AKA pupil-gaze dyskinesis
        if you see these things
            the palsy is not ischemic
            ALWAYS: MRI

    aberrant regeneration of CN3 without CN3P
        primary aberrant regeneration of CN3
        intradural aneurysms
        meningioma near cavernous sinus
        ALWAYS: MRI any time you see aberrant regeneration of CN3
            whether there's been a palsy or not
