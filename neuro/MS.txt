                INO
                    check saccades

            RARELY:
                ± retinal exudates

            RARELY: CME
                more common on fingolimod AKA Gilenya
                    fingolimod-associated CME
                        responds to topical steroids and NSAIDs but hard to wean
                        usually goes away if you stop the fingolimod
                            not always possible but speak to the neurologist
        NFL defects
        COMMON: optic neuritis
            1/4 of MS patients present initially with optic neuritis
            3/4 of MS patients get optic neuritis
                3/4 optic neuritis patients are female
            2/3 retrobulbar
                disc looks normal
            1/3 anterior
                disc edema
                    mild edema can still be typical
                    if disc swelling is severe
                        treat as atypical optic neuritis
                    distinguishing optic neuritis from NAION when there is swelling
                        age 50-
                        pain
                        slower onset
                            hours to days
                        may not have fellow disc at risk
                        no hemorrhages or exudates
                            at least for typical optic neuritis
                        central VF loss
                            AION is typically altitudinal
                        visual recovery is typically faster
                            more improvement in the first 4 weeks than AION
                        final VA is typically better
            course
                worse the first week
                then gradually improves
                expect some vision gains by 4 weeks
                    if not
                        treat as atypical optic neuritis
                best final vision can take a year
        retinal periphlebitis

    ancillary testing
        visual field defects
            chiasmal
            retrochiasmal
        ALWAYS: obtain VF testing in suspected optic neuritis
            Goldman if HVF not reliable OR poor VA
            you need to check for VF patterns that would change the diagnosis
                e.g. junctional scotoma of pituitary apoplexy
                compressive lesions can mimic optic neuritis
        OCT
            for fingolimod-associated CME

    investigations
        if there is retrobulbar optic neuritis
            ALWAYS: MRI brain + orbits ± gad + orbital fat suppression
                active WML
                    T1 post-contrast
                        for optic nerve enhancement
                        need orbital fat suppression to see the nerve light up
                    T2 flair
                        also T2 post-contrast
                        for periventricular WML
                        3+ mm ovoid lesions
                            radiating toward the ventricles
        if there is intermediate uveitis
            MRI may not be indicated
            neurology referral if there are neurologic symptoms
                they can decide on a scan

                    2+ oligoclonal IgG bands in CSF supports MS diagnosis
                    4+ oligoclonal IgG bands is strong evidence of MS
                    oligoclonal bands can be absent in MS

treatment

    ONTT
        all-comers, half will get MS over 15 y
        this increases to 3/4 if they have 1+ white-matter lesions on MRI
        oral steroids double the risk of recurrence
        IVMP 1 g daily x 3 d followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg x 11 d
            sped recovery by 1–2 weeks but didn't change outcomes
    if there are atypical optic neuritis biomarkers
        retrospective studies suggest IVMP within 3 days of onset improves final VA
        messy data: some patients also received plasmapheresis
        timing problem
            AQP4 and MOG take 1-2 weeks to appear
            so in practice this would mean treating all optic neuritis with IVMP
            waiting on prospective data

    systemic drugs for MS
        interferon-beta
            for patients with WML on MRI
