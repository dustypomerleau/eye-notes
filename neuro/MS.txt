MS

  systemic abnormalities
    cerebellar
    motor
    sensory
    sphincter
    mental
  eye movement abnormalitites
  CN abnormalities
  cerebellar or dorsal midbrain abnormalities
  intermediate uveitis
  papillitis
  retrobulbar optic neuritis

  symptoms
    diplopia
    cerebellar symptoms
      ataxia
      dysmetria
    motor symptoms
      weakness
      paresis
    sensory symptoms
      paresthesias
      neuralgia
    sphincter symptoms
      bladder and bowel control
      frequency
      urgency
    mental symptoms
      depression
      fatigue
      irritability
    symptoms may worsen with heat
      particularly vision
      AKA Uhthoff phenomenon

  eye movement abnormalities
    nystagmus
      many forms
      COMMON:
        pendular nystagmus
        PAN
    ocular flutter
    superior oblique myokymia
    fixation problems
      loss of smooth pursuit
      saccadic dysmetria

  CN abnormalities
    CN palsies
      COMMON: CN6
      ALSO:
        CN3
        CN4
        INO
          check saccades
            slow adducting saccades may be the only sign of a subtle INO
        WEBINO
    facial myokymia
      eyelid myokymia DDx
        COMMON: idiopathic
        ALSO:
          MS
          Meige syndrome
          precursor to hemifacial spasm or blepharospasm

  other neuro abnormalities
    cerebellar disease
      impaired VOR suppression
        can't fixate on outstretched hands in a swinging chair
    dorsal midbrain syndrome (DMS) AKA pretectal syndrome AKA Parinaud syndrome
      lid retraction
        inhibitory fibers to the levator are damaged
      limited upgaze
      skew deviation
      convergence-retraction nystagmus
      convergence spasm
        don't confuse this with an abduction deficit
      square wave jerks
        a form of fixation instability
          movement off to one side
          brief pause
          back to fixation
        distinct from pendular nystagmus
          which oscillates across fixation without stopping
      light-near dissociation
      DMS DDx
        COMMON:
          tumors
            AV malformation
            pinealoma
          hydrocephalus
        ALSO:
          MS
          vasculitis
          CVA
          hemorrhage
          trauma

  ocular findings
    intermediate uveitis
    papillitis
      RARELY:
        ± retinal exudates
        ± peripapillary IRH
      RARELY: CME
        more common on fingolimod AKA Gilenya
          fingolimod-associated CME
            responds to topical steroids and NSAIDs but hard to wean
            usually goes away if you stop the fingolimod
              not always possible but speak to the neurologist
    NFL defects
    COMMON: optic neuritis
      1/4 of MS patients present initially with optic neuritis
      3/4 of MS patients get optic neuritis
        3/4 optic neuritis patients are female
      2/3 retrobulbar
        disc looks normal
      1/3 anterior
        disc edema
          mild edema can still be typical
          if disc swelling is severe
            treat as atypical optic neuritis
          distinguishing optic neuritis from NAION when there is swelling
            age 50-
            pain
            slower onset
              hours to days
            may not have fellow disc at risk
            no hemorrhages OR exudates
              at least for typical optic neuritis
            central VF loss
              AION is typically altitudinal
            visual recovery is typically faster
              more improvement in the first 4 weeks than AION
            final VA is typically better
      course
        worse the first week
        then gradually improves
        expect some vision gains by 4 weeks
          if not
            treat as atypical optic neuritis
        best final vision can take a year
    retinal periphlebitis

  ancillary testing
    visual field defects
      chiasmal
      retrochiasmal
    ALWAYS: obtain VF testing in suspected optic neuritis
      Goldman if HVF not reliable OR poor VA
      you need to check for VF patterns that would change the diagnosis
        e.g. junctional scotoma of pituitary apoplexy
        compressive lesions can mimic optic neuritis
    OCT
      for fingolimod-associated CME

  investigations
    if there is retrobulbar optic neuritis
      ALWAYS: MRI brain + orbits ± gad + orbital fat suppression
        active WML
          T1 post-contrast
            for optic nerve enhancement
            need orbital fat suppression to see the nerve light up
          T2 flair
            also T2 post-contrast
            for periventricular WML
            3+ mm ovoid lesions
              radiating toward the ventricles
    if there is intermediate uveitis
      MRI may not be indicated
      neurology referral if there are neurologic symptoms
        they can decide on a scan

    ALSO:
      pattern VEP
        shows slowing of the P100 in optic neuritis
      LP
        protein electrophoresis + immunoblotting
          2+ oligoclonal IgG bands in CSF supports MS diagnosis
          4+ oligoclonal IgG bands is strong evidence of MS
          oligoclonal bands can be absent in MS
        CSF IgG and albumin
          for calculating the IgG index
      serum IgG and albumin
        for calculating the IgG index

treatment

  ONTT
    all-comers, half will get MS over 15 y
    this increases to 3/4 if they have 1+ white-matter lesions on MRI
    oral steroids double the risk of recurrence
    IVMP 1 g daily x 3 d followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg x 11 d
      sped recovery by 1-2 weeks but didn't change outcomes

  systemic drugs for MS
    interferon-beta
      for patients with WML on MRI
        reduces progression to clinically definite MS
          CHAMPS
          ETOMS
    glatiramer

  atypical presentation
    atypical findings
      age 50+
        think about GCA
      no improvement at 4 weeks
        should gain at least 1 line
      no pain on eye movement
      anterior uveitis
      marked disc swelling
        hemorrhage
        exudate
      chorioretinitis
    expand the DDx
      at a minimum:
        infectious
          TB
            Qgold
          syphilis
            serum RPR/FTA
          neurosyphilis
            LP with RPR/FTA
          bartonella
            bartonella titers
          Lyme // RARE in AU
            Lyme titers
        inflammatory
          sarcoid
            CXR
            ACE
            lysozyme
          lupus
            ANA
          NMO
            spinal MRI
            NMO antibodies
          GCA
            if 50+ YO
              ESR
        neoplastic
          BROADLY: any orbital compressive or infiltrative lesion
            orbital MRI
              MRI brain/orbits is standard for typical optic neuritis anyway
            FBC
        genetic
