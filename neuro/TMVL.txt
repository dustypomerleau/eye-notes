TMVL

remember your anatomy
    ICA
        ophthalmic artery
            collateral branches
                posterior ON
            central retinal artery
                collateral branches
                    anterior ON
                    ON head
                inner retina
            posterior ciliary arteries
                collateral branches
                    ON head
                short & long PCAs
                    choroid
                    outer retina
            anterior ciliary arteries
                run forward in the recti to supply the anterior segment
    ECA
        complex system of collaterals anastomose with ophthalmic artery branches
            so not all patients with ICA stenosis experience TMVL

many different symptom patterns
    COMMON: concentric dimming from hypoperfusion
    ALSO:
        curtain
        blotches or spots
        sectors
        positive phenomena
            white
            gray
    HA are COMMON in TMVL
        nearly 1/2 of cases if you ask
        does not automatically mean migraine
    if hypoperfusion is hemodynamic rather than embolic
        TMVL may be brought on by bright light
            trickle of retinal perfusion can't handle increased metabolic demand
            ASK about this in the history
            GCA can do this also
    if the patient has neurologic symptoms beyond HA
        hemisensory loss
        hemiparesis
        aphasia
            then they do not have true TMVL
                ADMIT and treat as TIA/CVA

TMVL DDx // do not shotgun these tests on exams - be appropriate
    embolic
        visible embolus in CRAO or BRAO
            true RAO is not usually transient but there is a continuum
            cholesterol Hollenhorst plaque
                yellow
                refractile
                COMMON: carotid
                RARELY:
                    aorta
                    heart valve
            fibrin-platelet white plaque
                long
                smooth
                dull white or gray
                caused by thrombosis
                can be a partner process to atherosclerosis

            COMMON: carotid
                carotid ultrasound
            risk factors
                age
                    carotids are unlikely to be the source under 50 YO
                        do the carotid US anyway
                    in young people
                        be more aggressive about looking for
                            cardiac source

        true amaurosis fugax from embolic causes above
            usually 5- minutes
                RARELY: under a minute
                    AOT TVOs
                1/5 will have longer attacks
                    15+ minutes
                    over an hour is possible but should make you question true amaurosis
    hemodynamic

            can be a combination of above hemodynamic mechanisms
        malignant hypertension
        reduced ophthalmic artery or CRA perfusion pressure
            press on the eye at the slitlamp
            CRA will occlude with minimal pressure
                this is true with *any* cause of reduced perfusion pressure
                does not mean the pathology is in the CRA or ophthalmic artery
                also true with very high IOP

            ophthalmic steal
        vasospasm
            not the same as migraine
            based on current understanding
                migraine mechanism is not vasospasm-related

                long list of conditions // see Petzold (2013)
            episode starts with arteriolar attenuation
                but this can be subtle
            progresses to venous and then arteriolar boxcarring
            calcium channel blockers will often break the attack
                nifedipine 20–80 mg
                may be needed as a daily dose in patients with recurrent vasospasm
    congenital disc anomalies
        PP staphyloma
        morning glory disc anomaly
            mechanism not clear
            can be positional
                may be a form of orthostatic TMVL
    neurologic
        neurologic exam

            technically you should never make this diagnosis on a first episode
