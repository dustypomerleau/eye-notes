TMVL

remember your anatomy
  ICA
    ophthalmic artery
      collateral branches
        posterior ON
      central retinal artery
        collateral branches
          anterior ON
          ON head
        inner retina
      posterior ciliary arteries
        collateral branches
          ON head
        short & long PCAs
          choroid
          outer retina
      anterior ciliary arteries
        run forward in the recti to supply the anterior segment
  ECA
    complex system of collaterals anastomose with ophthalmic artery branches
    not all patients with ICA stenosis experience TMVL

many different symptom patterns
  COMMON: concentric dimming from hypoperfusion
  ALSO:
    curtain
    blotches or spots
    sectors
    positive phenomena
      white
      grey
  HA are COMMON in TMVL
    nearly 1/2 of cases if you ask
    does not automatically mean migraine
  if hypoperfusion is haemodynamic rather than embolic
    TMVL may be brought on by bright light
      trickle of retinal perfusion can't handle increased metabolic demand
      ASK about this in the history
      GCA can do this also
  if the patient has neurologic symptoms beyond HA
    hemisensory loss
    hemiparesis
    aphasia
      then they do not have true TMVL
        ADMIT and treat as TIA/CVA

TMVL DDx // do not shotgun these tests for the RACE - be appropriate
  embolic
    visible embolus in CRAO OR BRAO
      true RAO is not usually transient but there is a continuum
      cholesterol Hollenhorst plaque
        yellow

        COMMON: carotid
        RARELY:

        long
        smooth
        dull white OR grey
        caused by thrombosis
        can be a partner process to atherosclerosis
        COMMON:
          carotid
          cardiac

    atherosclerosis
      COMMON: carotid
        carotid ultrasound
      risk factors
        age
          carotids are unlikely to be the source under 50 YO
            do the carotid US anyway
          in young people
            be more aggressive about looking for
              cardiac source
              hypercoagulable state
              vasculitis
        FH
          CAD
          CVA
        smoking
        HTN
        DM
        obesity
        high LDL
        low HDL
        sedentary lifestyle
        diet
          high sugar
          high saturated fat
          high trans fats
        TMVL may be postprandial in severe vasculopaths
          mesenteric steal
    cardiac thromboemboli
      echo
    dissection
      MRI + MRA
    hypercoagulable states
      hypercoagulable workup // see CRVO-BRVO.txt
    true amaurosis fugax from embolic causes above
      usually 5- minutes
        RARELY: under a minute
          AOT TVOs
        1/5 will have longer attacks
          15+ minutes
          over an hour is possible but should make you question true amaurosis
  haemodynamic
    postural hypotension
      orthostatic BP
      1˚
        autonomic dysfunction
          autonomic testing
            tilt table
            sweat test

      bloods for hyperviscosity with haematology assist
    pregnancy
      can be a combination of above haemodynamic mechanisms
    malignant hypertension
    reduced ophthalmic artery OR CRA perfusion pressure
      press on the eye at the slitlamp
      CRA will occlude with minimal pressure
        this is true with *any* cause of reduced perfusion pressure
        does not mean the pathology is in the CRA or ophthalmic artery
        also true with very high IOP
    gaze-evoked
      FB
      orbital tumour
        COMMON: ON sheath meningioma

        CRP
        TAB
    AV fistula OR AVM
      ophthalmic steal
    vasospasm
      not the same as migraine
      based on current understanding
        migraine mechanism is not vasospasm-related
      1˚

        long list of conditions // see Petzold 2013
      episode starts with arteriolar attenuation
        but this can be subtle
      progresses to venous and then arteriolar boxcarring
      calcium channel blockers will often break the attack
        nifedipine 20-80 mg
        may be needed as a daily dose in patients with recurrent vasospasm
  congenital disc anomalies
    PP staphyloma
    morning glory disc anomaly
      mechanism not clear
      can be positional
        may be a form of orthostatic TMVL

    neurologic exam
      if TIA symptoms
        ALWAYS: MRI
    migraine
      jagged edge

      technically you should never make this diagnosis on a first episode
    epilepsy
