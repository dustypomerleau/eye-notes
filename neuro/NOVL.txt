nonorganic visual loss

malingering implies intentional and willful misleading
  usually for 2˚ gain
somatoform disorders occur without the patient's knowledge
factitious disorders involve intentionally producing symptoms
  lying about symptoms
  self injury
  altering tests e.g. contaminating a urine sample
  not done for 2˚ gain
don't bother trying to subclassify NOVL
  determining secondary gains and motivations is difficult
  best to simply say nonorganic and be done with it
children
  COMMON: adolescents
    90+% girls in some series
  most of the time parents are not the problem but
    ALWAYS: consider
      child abuse
      negative home OR school situation
  COMMON: symmetric, bilateral symptoms
    COMMON:
      visual acuity loss
        any level is possible
        COMMON: 6/36+
      visual field loss
    ALSO:
      positive visual phenomena
        dots
        lines
        colors
        shapes
      HA
      eye pain

approach to NOVL
  confirm that the exam doesn't fit known patterns of organic disease
  use tests below to prove that the patient sees better than claimed
    NOVL is NEVER a diagnosis of exclusion
    you must show evidence that they can see
    organic causes can mimic psychiatric conditions and NOVL
      CVAs
      CNS tumors
  consider 2˚ causes of NOVL
    physical OR sexual abuse
    specific stressful life events
    undiagnosed psychiatric illness
      refer patients to a psychiatrist if you aren't sure
        psychiatric disease in NOVL is actually not that prevalent
        don't refer them just because they have NOVL
          this is very low yield and wastes everyone's time
  for adults
      reassure them that it isn't serious and they will get better
  for children
    allow the child to leave the room
    provide evidence of NOVL to the parents and reassure them
    ask for their assistance in recovering the child
      scolding children for NOVL usually makes it worse
    bring the child back
      reassure them that it isn't serious and they will get better

testing
  be systematic
  trust the tests
    your opinion of the patient is irrelevant
  tests useful for monocular NOVL
    pupil testing
      RAPD should be present if the patient claims profound monocular VA loss
    fogging the unaffected eye progressively while testing VA
      not the best technique
      can alert the patient that you are suspicious
      smart patients will squint to check both eyes before answering
    vertical prism dissociation test
      tell the patient
        I'm going to split the image and you will see double
        I'm going to test the good eye first
      show them a letter that's small but easy to read for the normal eye
        6/12 letter is good if one eye measures 6/6+
      4 ∆ BD in front of the eye with no complaint
      ask the patient
        What do you see?
          if they see 2 of the letter in question
            the eye with the complaint is 6/12+
    stereo testing
      say
        This is a test of how the eyes work together.
      9/12 Titmus circles is considered normal
      12/12 Titmus circles requires 6/6+ bilaterally & 40" stereo
      any stereopsis is helpful if the visual complaint is severe
    color testing
      Ishihara plates require relatively good acuity
        6/36+
      you can also perform Ishihara testing with red-green glasses
        put the green filter over the good eye (Green Good)
        the green filter makes Ishiharas unreadable
        any correctly identified plates must be read with the red filter eye
    red-green eye charts
      alternating red and green letters
      red-green glasses ensure that each letter can only be read by one eye
      say
        I'm going to do a short color test.
    polarized eye charts
      polarized glasses with vertical and horizontal axes
      same as red-green charts with alternating axes of polarization
  tests useful for monocular OR binocular NOVL
    // cover the good eye as needed in monocular NOVL
    reverse reading of the VA chart
      start at 6/4 and go slowly
      really push them at each line
    plano lenses
      say
        This lens will help magnify the chart a little.
      you can also use combinations of lenses that cancel
        patient blurs when you put a +3 in place
        then you put a -3 on top of it to give them plano again
    near VA testing
      near and distance acuity should be similar
        exceptions
          near VA is worse
            presbyopia
            PSC
          distance VA is worse
            NSC
            Adie tonic pupil
              near response is normal
              blurry when they switch back to distance
                but they slowly adjust
      NOVL patients will often read much better at near
    standard VA testing @ 1 & 2 m
      in a normal patient
        6/12 line @ 2 m can read 6/6 line @ 1 m
      NOVL will often read the same line at both distances
    magic drop OR magic lens may improve NOVL in kids
    proprioception testing
      should be normal even with poor vision
      have them touch their fingertips with outstretched arms + open eyes
    mirror test
      only useful for severe vision loss
        patient complaining of LP OR NPL
      occlude the better eye if the complaint is monocular
      rock the mirror side to side
      following the image proves HM+ VA
    OKN drum
      only useful for severe vision loss
      normal OKN response proves CF+ VA
      not as reliable as the mirror test
    electrophysiology
      pattern VEP
        more helpful than flash VEP
        tests a specific level of VA
          determined by pattern size
        helpful in cases with NOVL overlay on organic disease
        patients can sometimes trick the test by intentionally tuning out
        MFVEP
          best for sussing out subtle ON dysfunction
          not useful in NOVL
      ERG OR MFERG
        useful for excluding retinal pathology
        not generally useful for proving NOVL
    VF patterns typical of NOVL
      spiral field
        tangent screen OR Goldmann
        move clockwise systematically but go past your starting point
        patient brings field in further on the 2nd pass
      tunnel field
        test VF @ 1 & 2 m
        normal patients have a funnel field
          larger @ 2 m
        NOVL may give the same field at both distances
      monocular hemianopia that persists with bilateral testing
        assumes a normal eye exam without RAPD
        testing with both eyes open should eliminate the hemianopia
      saccade testing
        a patient with true VF loss has trouble accurately saccading
          place 1 finger in 1˚ and another in the area of field loss
          the patient with NOVL will saccade accurately to finger 2
