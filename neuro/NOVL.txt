nonorganic visual loss

malingering implies intentional and willful misleading
    usually for 2° gain
somatoform disorders occur without the patient's knowledge
factitious disorders involve intentionally producing symptoms
    lying about symptoms
    self injury
    altering tests e.g. contaminating a urine sample
    not done for 2° gain
don't bother trying to subclassify NOVL
    determining secondary gains and motivations is difficult
    best to simply say nonorganic and be done with it
children
    COMMON: adolescents
        90+% girls in some series
    most of the time parents are not the problem but
        ALWAYS: consider
            child abuse
            negative home or school situation
    COMMON: symmetric, bilateral symptoms
        COMMON:
            visual acuity loss
                any level is possible
                COMMON: 6/36+
            visual field loss
        ALSO:
            positive visual phenomena
                dots
                lines
                colors
                shapes
            HA
            eye pain

approach to NOVL
    confirm that the exam doesn't fit known patterns of organic disease
    use tests below to prove that the patient sees better than claimed
        NOVL is NEVER a diagnosis of exclusion
        you must show evidence that they can see
        organic causes can mimic psychiatric conditions and NOVL
            CVAs
            CNS tumors
    consider 2° causes of NOVL
        physical OR sexual abuse
        specific stressful life events
        undiagnosed psychiatric illness
            refer patients to a psychiatrist if you aren't sure
                psychiatric disease in NOVL is actually not that prevalent
                don't refer them just because they have NOVL
                    this is very low yield and wastes everyone's time
    for adults
            reassure them that it isn't serious and they will get better
    for children
        allow the child to leave the room
        provide evidence of NOVL to the parents and reassure them
        ask for their assistance in recovering the child
            scolding children for NOVL usually makes it worse
        bring the child back
            reassure them that it isn't serious and they will get better

testing
    be systematic
    trust the tests
        your opinion of the patient is irrelevant
    tests useful for monocular NOVL
        pupil testing
            RAPD should be present if the patient claims profound monocular VA loss
        fogging the unaffected eye progressively while testing VA
            not the best technique
            can alert the patient that you are suspicious
            smart patients will squint to check both eyes before answering
        vertical prism dissociation test
            tell the patient
                I'm going to split the image and you will see double
                I'm going to test the good eye first
            show them a letter that's small but easy to read for the normal eye
                6/12 letter is good if one eye measures 6/6+
            4 ∆ BD in front of the eye with no complaint
            ask the patient
                What do you see?
                    if they see 2 of the letter in question
                        the eye with the complaint is 6/12+
        stereo testing
            say
                This is a test of how the eyes work together.
            9/12 Titmus circles is considered normal
            12/12 Titmus circles requires 6/6+ bilaterally & 40" stereo
            any stereopsis is helpful if the visual complaint is severe
        color testing
            Ishihara plates require relatively good acuity
                6/36+
            you can also perform Ishihara testing with red-green glasses
                put the green filter over the good eye (Green Good)
                the green filter makes Ishiharas unreadable
                any correctly identified plates must be read with the red filter eye
        red-green eye charts
            alternating red and green letters
            red-green glasses ensure that each letter can only be read by one eye
            say
                I'm going to do a short color test.
        polarized eye charts
            polarized glasses with vertical and horizontal axes
            same as red-green charts with alternating axes of polarization
    tests useful for monocular OR binocular NOVL
        // cover the good eye as needed in monocular NOVL
        reverse reading of the VA chart
            start at 6/4 and go slowly
            really push them at each line
        plano lenses
            say
                This lens will help magnify the chart a little.
            you can also use combinations of lenses that cancel
                patient blurs when you put a +3 in place
                then you put a -3 on top of it to give them plano again
        near VA testing
            near and distance acuity should be similar
                exceptions
                    near VA is worse
                        presbyopia
                        PSC
                    distance VA is worse
                        NSC
                        Adie tonic pupil
                            near response is normal
                            blurry when they switch back to distance
                                but they slowly adjust
            NOVL patients will often read much better at near
        standard VA testing @ 1 & 2 m
            in a normal patient
                6/12 line @ 2 m can read 6/6 line @ 1 m
            NOVL will often read the same line at both distances
        magic drop or magic lens may improve NOVL in kids
        proprioception testing
            should be normal even with poor vision
            have them touch their fingertips with outstretched arms + open eyes
        mirror test
            only useful for severe vision loss
                patient complaining of LP OR NPL
            occlude the better eye if the complaint is monocular
            rock the mirror side to side
            following the image proves HM+ VA
        OKN drum
            only useful for severe vision loss
            normal OKN response proves CF+ VA
            not as reliable as the mirror test
        electrophysiology
            pattern VEP
                more helpful than flash VEP
                tests a specific level of VA
                    determined by pattern size
                helpful in cases with NOVL overlay on organic disease
                patients can sometimes trick the test by intentionally tuning out
                MFVEP
                    best for sussing out subtle ON dysfunction
                    not useful in NOVL
            ERG OR MFERG
                useful for excluding retinal pathology
                not generally useful for proving NOVL
        VF patterns typical of NOVL
            spiral field
                tangent screen OR Goldmann
                move clockwise systematically but go past your starting point
                patient brings field in further on the 2nd pass
            tunnel field
                test VF @ 1 & 2 m
                normal patients have a funnel field
                    larger @ 2 m
                NOVL may give the same field at both distances
            monocular hemianopia that persists with bilateral testing
                assumes a normal eye exam without RAPD
                testing with both eyes open should eliminate the hemianopia
            saccade testing
                a patient with true VF loss has trouble accurately saccading
                    place 1 finger in 1° and another in the area of field loss
                    the patient with NOVL will saccade accurately to finger 2
