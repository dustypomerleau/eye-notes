nystagmus

nystagmus may take time to characterize
    approach systematically
        monocular or binocular
        horizontal, vertical, or rotary
        jerk or pendular
        presence of a null point

checking VA with fixation-induced nystagmus
    fog the fellow eye
        +3 D is enough
    full occlusion will make the nystagmus worse

regardless of pattern, examine the eyes for a sensory cause

when don't you need an MRI?

                    normal CT scan
                        ALWAYS: scan before diagnosing Wernicke syndrome
                        OK to treat empirically while waiting on imaging
                        MRI T2 FLAIR and DWI will show lesions
                            COMMON:

                easy to treat even if you aren't sure
                    empiric thiamine + Mg has minimal downside
                        Mg is a thiamine cofactor in glucose metabolism
                        if Mg is low, thiamine alone will not correct the problem
                    risk of coma and death if you don't treat
                    serum thiamine + Mg levels will confirm the diagnosis

1.5 syndrome
    INO + ipsilateral CN6P
    lesion takes out MLF + (PPRF OR CN6 nucleus) on the same side
    total horizontal gaze palsy on that side
    only abduction of the opposite eye intact
    important distinction in 1.5 versus typical INO
        MLF crosses very low at the level of the CN6 nucleus
            typical INO
                MLF affected after crossing during vertical ascent to CN3 nucleus
                the eye that can't adduct is on the same side as the lesion
            1.5 syndrome
                MLF affected on the same side as the affected CN6 nucleus
                complete horizontal gaze paralysis is on the same side as the lesion
        in both INO and 1.5
            convergence should be intact

            anatomy and pathways for this are still poorly understood
        VOR AKA doll's eye reflex
            allows you to track an object while turning your head
            attenuates rapidly after the head turn starts
                needs the OKN to be useful for tracking an object
            normal patients can suppress the VOR // see MS.txt
        OKN
            adds smooth pursuit to the VOR when you're fixed on an object
            supplements the VOR with saccades
                when speed of the object exceeds smooth pursuit
                when you hit the limit of pursuit in the direction of movement
