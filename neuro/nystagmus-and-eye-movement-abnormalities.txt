nystagmus

nystagmus may take time to characterize
  approach systematically
    monocular or binocular
    horizontal, vertical, or rotary
    jerk or pendular
    presence of a null point

checking VA with fixation-induced nystagmus
  fog the fellow eye
    +3 D is enough
  full occlusion will make the nystagmus worse

regardless of pattern, examine the eyes for a sensory cause

when don't you need an MRI?

      sensory
      amblyopia or high refractive error
      optic or chiasmal glioma
      MS
    horizontal
      usually longstanding sensory or amblyopia
      AKA Heimann-Bielschowsky phenomenon
    vertical
      MRI for ON or chiasmal glioma

  infantile
    sensory
    motor AKA congenital motor nystagmus
      relatively good VA

      null point
        ± AHP
      absent during sleep
      OKN inversion
      XLD > XLR
  latent nystagmus
    jerk away from the covered eye
    look for infantile ET

    MRI for Chiari malformation or spinocerebellar degeneration
      include the spine
    lithium toxicity
    Wernicke syndrome
  PAN
    2+ minutes to cycle

  see-saw

      CVA
      demyelination
      tumor
      MRI for ipsilateral brainstem lesion
    Wernicke syndrome AKA Wernicke encephalopathy

              upgaze limitation
              skew deviation
          ataxia
          normal CT scan
            ALWAYS: scan before diagnosing Wernicke syndrome
            OK to treat empirically while waiting on imaging
            MRI T2 FLAIR and DWI will show lesions
              COMMON:
                thalamus
                hypothalamus
                4th ventricle
        COMMON: alcohol abuse
        ALSO:
          malnutrition
          persistent vomiting
          bariatric or bowel surgery
          eating disorders
        easy to treat even if you aren't sure
          empiric thiamine + Mg has minimal downside
            Mg is a thiamine cofactor in glucose metabolism
            if Mg is low, thiamine alone will not correct the problem
          risk of coma and death if you don't treat
          serum thiamine + Mg levels will confirm the diagnosis
  vestibular
    vertigo
    nausea
    better with fixation
    pattern varies with gaze direction

treatment
  baclofen
  gabapentin
  RARELY: BOTOX
  surgery
    if there is a null point
      Anderson-Kestenbaum
        bilateral R & R
        moves both eyes away from the null point
        places the null point closer to fixation in a neutral head position
        short version:
          move the eyes in the direction of the head turn
    if there is no null point
      Dell'Osso

  supranuclear gaze palsy // see below

1.5 syndrome
  INO + ipsilateral CN6P
  lesion takes out MLF + (PPRF OR CN6 nucleus) on the same side
  total horizontal gaze palsy on that side
  only abduction of the opposite eye intact
  important distinction in 1.5 versus typical INO
    MLF crosses very low at the level of the CN6 nucleus
      typical INO
        MLF affected after crossing during vertical ascent to CN3 nucleus
        the eye that can't adduct is on the same side as the lesion
      1.5 syndrome
        MLF affected on the same side as the affected CN6 nucleus
        complete horizontal gaze paralysis is on the same side as the lesion
    in both INO and 1.5
      convergence should be intact
        ask the patient to cross their eyes

    microsaccades

    smooth pursuit
    vergence
      anatomy and pathways for this are still poorly understood
    VOR AKA doll's eye reflex
      allows you to track an object while turning your head
      attenuates rapidly after the head turn starts
        needs the OKN to be useful for tracking an object
      normal patients can suppress the VOR // see MS.txt
    OKN
      adds smooth pursuit to the VOR when you're fixed on an object
      supplements the VOR with saccades
        when speed of the object exceeds smooth pursuit
        when you hit the limit of pursuit in the direction of movement
      attenuates after 30 seconds even in normals
  supranuclear disorders
