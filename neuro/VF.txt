visual fields

  ALWAYS: order a HVF for
    good VA and normal exam but
      subjectively blurry vision OR
      trouble reading

  before you try to localize a VF defect
    describe what you see in a way that will trigger keywords
      'This is an incongruous, homonymous VF defect involving fixation'
      'This is a bitemporal hemianopia restricted to the central vision'

  'hemianopia' doesn't necessarily mean the whole hemifield is missing
    tends to be used for anything bigger than a quadrantanopia

  From the chiasm forward you are more likely to see:
    APD
    poor color vision
    abnormality of the disc on exam

VF patterns by lesion location

  optic nerve
    PMB
      central
      cecocentral
        connects to blind spot
      paracentral
    temporal fibers
      enter at S & I poles of the disc
      extension of the blind spot
        comma shape
      arcuate
      nasal step
    nasal fibers
      temporal VF wedge
        originates from the blind spot
        spares fixation
          AOT lesions behind the chiasm that originate from fixation
    ON drusen can cause any pattern of VF loss
      if an unexplained VF defect is leaving you stumped
        ALWAYS: BSUS for disc drusen

  junction of ON and chiasm
    junctional scotoma
      poor vision in one eye
        central scotoma
      ST wedge in the fellow eye
        from compression of the decussating fibers in Wilbrand's knee
          // no one knows if it exists but it helps explain the pattern

  // VF defects from this point on originate from fixation

  chiasm
    nerve may show band atrophy
    full bitemporal hemianopia
    macular bitemporal hemianopia

  // VF defects from this point on are opposite the side of the lesion
  // congruity increases as you move further back

  optic tract
    subtle APD in the opposite eye is possible
      more fibers decussate
    incongruous homonymous hemianopia

  LGB
    lesions here are RARE in real life
    relatively congruous homonymous hemianopia or wedge

  /*
  temporal and parietal lobe lesions can cause almost anything congruous
    small wedge to a nearly complete hemianopia
    depends on how big the lesion is and how far back
    usually temporal or parietal lobe lesions have other neurologic signs
    homonymous defect in isolation
      COMMON: occipital lobe lesions
  */

  anterior temporal lobe
    Meyer's loop
      inferior fibers
    homonymous pie in the sky defect
      more congruous than an optic tract lesion
    usually won't reach fixation
      macular fibers don't course very far forward
      the larger the temporal lobe lesion, the closer the wedge gets to fixation

  parietal lobe
    homonymous pie on the floor defect
      more congruous than an optic tract lesion
    additional parietal lobe neurologic signs
      contralateral sensory impairment
        reduced pain OR touch
      poor object recognition
      poor position sense
      dominant parietal lobe
        apraxia
          poor motor planning
        aphasia
        acalculia
        finger agnosia
        right-left disorientation
      nondominant parietal lobe
        hemispacial neglect
        denial of neurologic impairment
        abnormal drawing and copying

  occipital lobe
    highly congruous homonymous hemianopia
      COMMON: macula and periphery both affected
        complete homonymous defect
      inner occipital lobe lesion with sparing of the tip
        macular VF may be spared
      lesion of the tip only
        macular VF may be affected with sparing of the periphery
    for any relatively homonymous hemianopia
      check the OKN response
      pure occipital lesions will have a normal OKN response
      large parietal OR parieto + occipital lesions
        may show abnormal OKN responses
          abnormal OKN when rotating the drum to the patient's right
            indicates a R parieto-occipital lesion

Goldmann VF
  stimulus
    size
      0-V
    intensity
      1–4 in 5 dB increments
      a-e in 1 dB increments
    dB are a relative measurement
      1 dB is the brightest light the machine can produce
        1 dB = (1/10^0)(the brightest light the machine can produce)
      10 dB = (1/10^1)(the brightest light the machine can produce)
      20 dB = (1/10^2)(the brightest light the machine can produce)
    to clarify
      lower dB values are brighter lights
      4 and e are the brightest lights in their groups
      4 and e have the lowest dB values in their groups
  typical settings
    normal eye with 6/6 VA
      macular isopter mapped with I 2e
      peripheral isopter mapped with I 4e
    increase stimulus size based on VA
      size I is good until about 6/60
      VA 6/60-
        ALWAYS: use the brightest (4e) stimulus
        increase from I-IV until they see it
    once you have mapped the macular isopter
      if there is a defect
        map that area with increasing brightness
          I 2e -> I 3e -> I 4e
      if the defect persists
        map that area with increasing target size
          II 4e -> III 4e -> IV 4e -> V 4e
    once you have mapped the peripheral isopter
      generally you are already on the brightest (4e) stimulus
      map any defect with increasing target size
        II 4e -> III 4e -> IV 4e -> V 4e
  interpreting Goldmann VF
    first look at the shape
      Are there dents in the isopter?
        normal Goldmann VF should be ovoid
    then look at the size
      roughly
        normal macular isopter
          30+° horizontally (each direction)
          20+° vertically (usually more inferiorly)
        normal peripheral isopter
          50+° nasally
          60+° temporally
        typical blind spot
          10° across
