anisocoria
  Does the pupil react to light?
    if one pupil is poorly reactive
      that is the problematic pupil
    if both pupils are reactive
      measure pupillary diameter in light and dark conditions
        greater difference in the dark
          smaller pupil is abnormal
            can't dilate
            subtle cases may show a dilation lag instead
              when you dim the lights
                anisocoria @ 5 seconds > anisocoria @ 15 seconds
        greater difference in the light
          larger pupil is abnormal
            can't constrict
            subtle cases may show a constriction lag instead
              when you turn on the lights
                anisocoria @ 5 seconds > anisocoria @ 15 seconds
            8+ mm should make you think pharmacologic
              CN3P dilation is not usually this large
  Is there an RAPD?
    severity
      dilates as soon as you swing to that side
      dilates after a pause
      constricts but settles at a larger size than the fellow eye
  Is the near reflex normal?
    light near dissociation
      dorsal midbrain syndrome
      advanced syphilis
      not pathognomonic
        can be seen in
          optic neuropathy
          advanced retinopathy
  be systematic
    measurements in light
    measurements in dark
    direct
    consensual
    swinging
      RAPD?
    near reflex
      make sure you start them on a distant target and then switch
  Is there sectoral weakness?
    typical of an Adie tonic pupil
      results in vermiform movements on attempted constriction
  Is there iris atrophy?
    uveitis
      HSV
      VZV
    ischemia
  Does the patient have a headache?
    young patient with a thunderclap HA and poorly reactive dilated pupil
      aneurysm until proven otherwise
  Are the lids and motility normal?
    Savino rule
      when confronted with an abnormality of 1 of these 3 things
        lids
        pupil
        motility
      ALWAYS: check the other 2
      this way you won't miss CN3P, Horner, etc.
  Is the rest of the eye exam normal?
    there are many causes of an RAPD
  Is the rest of the neurologic exam normal?

DDx anisocoria
  physiologic
    1/5 of normal patients if you look for it
  RAPD due to ocular disease
  CN3P // see ptosis.txt & HT-vertical-strabismus.txt
  Horner // see ptosis.txt
  PS 2Â° inflammation
  Adie tonic pupil
    local ciliary ganglion or short ciliary nerve damage
    vermiform sectoral weakness
    denervation hypersensitivity to dilute 0.1% pilocarpine
    despite sluggish pupil response in the light
      near response is usually normal
      blurry when they switch back to distance
        but they slowly adjust
  ischemia
    anterior segment ischemia
    ACG
  pharmacologic
    do all of your other testing before instilling agents to test this
      e.g. you need to test dilute pilo for Adie before testing full strength
  trauma
    sphincter tears
