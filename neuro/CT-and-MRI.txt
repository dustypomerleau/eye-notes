CT versus MRI

bone
    very bright on CT
    medium bright on MRI

vitreous or CSF
    dark on T1
    bright on T2

vascular lumens
    bright on T1 post-gad // T2 is usually done before contrast

orbital fat
    not reliable
        usually bright on T1 + T2
            but fat suppression is standard on most orbital studies

CT is preferred for
    fast study
    bone
        fractures
        calcifications e.g. Rb
    acute hemorrhage
        good for ruling out intracranial bleed
