CT versus MRI

bone
  very bright on CT
  medium bright on MRI

vitreous or CSF
  dark on T1
  bright on T2

vascular lumens
  bright on T1 post-gad
  (T2 is usually done before contrast)

orbital fat
  not reliable
    usually bright on T1 & T2
      but fat suppression is standard on most orbital studies

CT is preferred for
  fast study
  bone
    fractures
    calcifications e.g. Rb
  acute hemorrhage
    good for ruling out intracranial bleed
