chiasmal lesions

    chiasmal lesion DDx
        COMMON:
            pituitary adenoma
                if the onset of a bitemporal hemianopia is acute
                    assume pituitary apoplexy OR suprasellar aneurysm
                        hemorrhage into a preexisting pituitary adenoma
                            severe HA
                            mental status changes
                            CN deficits
                    ALWAYS: MRI
                    labs
                        prolactin
                        GH
                        ACTH
                        TSH
                    pituitary apoplexy is life threatening
                        deficiency of all pituitary hormones
                        cortisol deficiency is the most dangerous
                        ADMIT for imaging and hormone replacement
                        multidisciplinary
                            endocrine
                            neurosurgery
                                may need decompression
                    for isolated prolactinoma
                        endocrine + neurosurgery to follow
                            will usually start with bromocriptine
                            may need transsphenoidal decompression
                                progressive vision loss OR VF loss despite medical therapy
        ALSO:
            suprasellar ICA aneurysm
            meningioma
            craniopharyngioma
        RARELY:
            TB
            lyme
            sarcoid
            MS

    hemifield slide phenomenon
        loss of overlapping ganglion cell receptive fields
            from corresponding areas of nasal and fellow temporal retina
        loss of fusion
        inability to suppress a natural phoria
        then becomes a tropia
        causes diplopia

    post-fixational blindness
        temporal visual field gives stereo context to objects beyond fixation
        bitemporal hemianopia causes post-fixational blindness
            images beyond fixation fall on the temporal visual field
        exacerbated by hemifield slide

    band atrophy
        fibers responsible for the nasal macula
            enter straight into the nerve via the PMB
        fibers from the nasal peripheral retina
            enter straight into the nasal aspect of the disc
        fibers from the temporal macula and temporal retina
            sweep into the superior and inferior poles of the disc
        compression the decussating nasal fibers in the chiasm
            causes atrophy at 0300 & 0900
            results in a bowtie or band atrophy pattern
        if the optic tract is involved
            there may be band atrophy on the contralateral side AND
            diffuse atrophy OR vertical band atrophy on the ipsilateral side

    VF patterns
        COMMON: bitemporal hemianopia
        ALSO:
            bitemporal superior quadrantanopia
            bitemporal inferior quadrantanopia
            unilateral temporal hemianopia
            junctional scotoma
                compression at the junction of the nerve and chiasm
                central field loss on the affected side
                    small scotoma up to complete VF defect
                ST defect in the fellow eye
