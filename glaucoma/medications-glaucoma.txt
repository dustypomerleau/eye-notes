glaucoma medications in pregnancy and breastfeeding

    Typically the IOP is a bit lower in pregnant women, but don't rely on this.

    1st line
        observation
        SLT

    drug categories
        A - safe
        B - contradictory data
        C - risk to the fetus in animal studies
        D - risk to the fetus in human studies
        X - strong evidence of birth defects

        brimonidine
            category B
            safest early in the pregnancy
            should be avoided when nursing
                in children it causes
                    CNS depression
                    apnea
        beta blockers
            category C
            cross placenta
            enter breast milk
            low doses can be used throughout
            monitor fetal heart rate
        CAI
            category C
                low fetal body weight in animal studies
                unclear if breastmilk affected
            low doses can be used throughout
            monitor fetal body weight
        prostaglandins
            category C
            miscarriages and uterine contractions in animal studies
            most docs don't use at all
            definitely avoid in 3rd trimester

    ways to avoid systemic toxicity
        lowest drug concentration
        least frequent dosing
        closed eyelids after administration
        manual punctal occlusion
        punctal plugs

    avoid glaucoma surgery in pregnancy
        particularly 1st trimester
        anesthetics and antimetabolites can be teratogenic

    other medications in pregnancy //...
        oral antibiotics
            avoid
                tetracyclines
                fluoroquinolones
        topical antibiotics
            effect of topical quinolones is unclear
            tobramycin is often substituted if coverage is adequate
        oral antivirals
            aciclovir is safe
            valaciclovir is probably safe but less studied
                category B
        dry eye
            avoid cyclosporine
