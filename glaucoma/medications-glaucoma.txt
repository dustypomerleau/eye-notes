glaucoma medications in pregnancy and breastfeeding

  Typically the IOP is a bit lower in pregnant women, but don't rely on this.

  1st line
    observation
    SLT

  drug categories
    A - safe
    B - contradictory data
    C - risk to the fetus in animal studies
    D - risk to the fetus in human studies
    X - strong evidence of birth defects

    brimonidine
      category B
      safest early in the pregnancy
      should be avoided when nursing
        in children
          CNS depression
          apnea
    beta blockers
      category C
      cross placenta
      enter breast milk
      low doses can be used throughout
      monitor foetal heart rate
    CAI
      category C
        low foetal body weight in animal studies
        unclear if breastmilk affected
      low doses can be used throughout
      monitor foetal body weight
    prostaglandins
      category C
      miscarriages and uterine contractions in animal studies
      most docs don't use at all
      definitely avoid in 3rd trimester

  ways to avoid systemic toxicity:
    lowest drug concentration
    least frequent dosing
    closed eyelids after administration
    manual punctal occlusion
    punctal plugs

  avoid glaucoma surgery in pregnancy
    particularly 1st trimester
    anesthetics and antimetabolites can be teratogenic

  other medications in pregnancy
    // you may want to break this out into its own .txt
    oral antibiotics
      avoid
        tetracyclines
        fluoroquinolones
    topical antibiotics
      effect of topical quinolones is unclear
      tobramycin is often substituted if coverage is adequate
    oral antivirals
      aciclovir is safe
      valaciclovir is probably safe but less studied
        category B
    dry eye
      avoid cyclosporine
