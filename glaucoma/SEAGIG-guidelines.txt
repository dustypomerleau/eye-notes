      for exam purposes
        treat Goldmann as the standard
      in reality
        pneumotonometry is probably superior

  treatment goals
    30% IOP reduction
      moderate+ VF loss
      perfect treatment would match episcleral venous pressure
        7-12 mm Hg
    20% IOP reduction
      early VF loss
      OHTN 30+ mm Hg + suspicious disc
    if no VF loss and IOP 30-
      tally risk factors to decide on treatment versus observation
