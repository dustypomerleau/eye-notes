These conclusions are from the AAO's meta-analysis of the effect of CEIOL in various types of glaucoma.
*/

POAG + NTG
    if controlled with 1 or 2 medications
        CEIOL reduces IOP 13% on average
            greater reduction for those with higher preop IOP
        1/4 have higher IOP after CEIOL
        1/6 will have a postop IOP spike

PXG
    if controlled with 1 or 2 medications
        CEIOL reduces IOP 20% on average
        1/3 will require fewer glaucoma medications postop
        1/3 will require more glaucoma medications postop
            before performing CEIOL in PXG
                consider the ability of the patient to tolerate an IOP spike

chronic PACG
    if controlled with 1+ medications
        CEIOL reduces IOP 30% on average
            even when there are PAS
        1/2+ will require fewer glaucoma medications postop
    in poorly controlled PACG
        CEIOL still reduces IOP in most patients
    data on IOP spikes is not great in this group

acute PACG
    relatively urgent CEIOL after initial medical + LPI IOP reduction
        often eliminated the need for any chronic treatment
    study sizes are much smaller for this group
    try not to operate until the eye is white and quiet
