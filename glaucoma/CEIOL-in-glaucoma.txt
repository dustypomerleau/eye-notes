/*
These conclusions are from the AAO's meta-analysis of the effect of CEIOL in various types of glaucoma.
*/

POAG + NTG
  if controlled with 1 or 2 medications
    CEIOL reduces IOP 13% on average
      greater reduction for those with higher preop IOP
    1/4 have higher IOP after CEIOL
    1/6 will have a postop IOP spike

PXG
  if controlled with 1 or 2 medications
    CEIOL reduces IOP 20% on average
    1/3 will require fewer glaucoma medications postop
    1/3 will require more glaucoma medications postop
      before performing CEIOL in PXG
        consider the ability of the patient to tolerate an IOP spike

chronic PACG
  if controlled with 1+ medications
    CEIOL reduces IOP 30% on average
      even when there are PAS
    1/2+ will require fewer glaucoma medications postop
  in poorly controlled PACG
    CEIOL still reduces IOP in most patients
  data on IOP spikes is not great in this group

acute PACG
  relatively urgent CEIOL after initial medical + LPI IOP reduction
    often eliminated the need for any chronic treatment
  study sizes are much smaller for this group
  try not to operate until the eye is white and quiet
