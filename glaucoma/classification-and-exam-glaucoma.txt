        NFL defect OR
        VF defect
        +
        adult onset
        open angle
      EGS adds
        age 35+
        IOP 21+
    assessment
      exam
        disc asymmetry
        rim loss
        notch
        NFL defect
        disc hemorrhage
        vertically enlarged cup
          usually 0.7+
      imaging
        red free photographs of the NFL
        stereo disc photos
        ± HRA OR GDx
      automated perimetry
        VF defect should correlate with structure
        repeatable
        COMMON: vertical hemifield asymmetry
        cluster of depressed points
        progressive
        // see ON-imaging-and-VFs.txt
    treatment
      target IOP at least 20% below baseline
      tailor target IOP based on risk
        low OR moderate risk suspect
          normal VF
        high risk suspect OR moderate POAG
        high risk POAG
          VF loss within 5˚ of fixation OR
          VF defects in both hemifields
  JOAG
  NTG
  OHTN
  glaucoma suspect (regardless of IOP)
  2˚ OAG
    pigmentary glaucoma
      COMMON: myopic males in their 30s+
      ALSO:
        FH
        blurred vision after strenuous exercise
      flat Ks
      Krukenberg spindle
      radial spoke-like midperipheral TID
      gonio
        posterior iris bowing
          reverse pupillary block
          value of LPI much debated
            Scott (2011)
              LPI did not reduce progression from PDS to PG
            Gandolfi (2014)
              LPI reduced IOP elevation 5 mm Hg above baseline phasing
                from 60% to 15%
        heavy angle pigment
          may be greater superiorly
            helps to distinguish from other causes of angle pigment
      1/10 progress from PDS to PG @ 10 years
      treatment
        LPI
          debated
        medical therapy
        SLT with low settings
        surgery only in advanced disease
    uveitic glaucoma
    lens-associated glaucoma
      topical steroids
      temporize medically
      urgent CEIOL

    angle recession glaucoma
    ghost-cell glaucoma
    Schwartz syndrome
    elevated episcleral venous pressure (e.g. CC fistula)
    in a patient with apparent disc damage and normal pressure
      ALWAYS: consider the possibility of a previously elevated IOP

  PACD // based on Walland (2012), the AU standard
    in general
      treat 3+ quads of ATM or less (PACS, PAC ± G)
        LPI
        ± ALPI
        + meds if the IOP is still too high
      if the IOP is too high after that
        CEIOL
          VS cataract
          very shallow AC
        trabeculectomy
          GON
          PAS 180+˚
            i.e. don't do CEIOL alone with PAS 180+˚
            even if the IOP is OK
    PACS // AKA occludable angles
      3+ quads of ATM or less
        some use 180˚ of ATM or less but wouldn't treat until 3+ quads
      no PAS
      normal IOP
      treatment
        indications
          3+ quads of ATM or less OR
          FH OR

    PAC
      PACS +
        PAS OR
        IOP 22+
      treatment
        LPI
        if angle doesn't open
          ALPI
            avoid areas of PAS
        add meds if needed
        if IOP still too high
          for PAS 180-˚
            VS cataract
              CEIOL
            clear lens but very shallow AC
              CEIOL
            clear lens with reasonable AC depth
              try to avoid surgery
                MMT
                repeat ALPI
                SLT to open angle only
          for PAS 180+˚
            VS cataract
              phacotrab
            clear lens but very shallow AC
              phacotrab
            clear lens with reasonable AC depth
              trab alone
    PACG
      PAC + structural disc damage OR VF loss
      treatment
        same as PAC except never do CEIOL alone
        if the IOP is too high after LPI ± ALPI + meds
          trab alone vs phacotrab depending on cataract and AC depth
    APAC
      PAC + some combination of
        pain
        nausea
        conj injection
        MCE
        shallow AC
        mid-dilated NR pupil
      treatment
        LPI is the definitive therapy
        debate about miotics as you know
        topical antihypertensives to temporize
        mannitol
          hang 500 mL 20% mannitol
          give 1 g/kg over 1 hour
            (100 g if you give the whole bag)
        LPI
        RARELY: ALPI to improve success at LPI creation
          technically hard because of peripheral MCE
        RARELY: tap the AC to break an attack
          use a 30 g needle rather than a paracentesis
        surgery
          for PAS 180-˚
            // all surgery assumes you've waited for a quiet eye
            if IOP is controlled
              VS cataract
                CEIOL
              clear lens
                observe
            if IOP is still too high over 3 days              VS cataract
                phacotrab
              clear lens but very shallow AC
                phacotrab
              clear lens with reasonable AC depth
                trab alone
          for PAS 180+˚
            // all surgery assumes you've waited for a quiet eye
            same as PAS 180-˚ except you never do CEIOL alone
              phacotrab even if IOP relatively controlled
                you can tie the sutures tight and lyse them later as needed
        ALWAYS: fellow eye LPI
      trabeculectomy alone
      if VS cataract OR very shallow AC
        trabeculectomy + CEIOL

  2˚ ACG // based on the AAO guidelines
    with pupillary block
      intumescent lens
        if ACG has a phacomorphic component

        suprachoroidal effusion or hemorrhage
        scleral buckle
        posterior segment tumor
