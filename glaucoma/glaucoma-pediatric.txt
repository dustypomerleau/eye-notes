pediatric glaucoma

    primary congenital glaucoma
        COMMON: sporadic
        RARELY: AR
        related to
            LTBP2
            CYP1B1
            consanguinity
        epiphora
        photophobia
        blepharospasm
        ALWAYS: EUA
            non-inhalational induction if possible
                ketamine
            elevated IOP
                check quickly at induction
                will decrease under GA
            increased horizontal corneal diameter
                11.5+ mm at birth
                12.5+ mm at 1 y
                    in practice
                        11+ in the first year
                        13+ at any age
                    may be easiest to think of both ends in terms of ranges
                        normal
                            birth 9–11
                            1+ years old 10–13
                ± corneal clouding
            buphthalmos
                a bluish hue can tip you off if the sclera is stretched thin
                quantify
                    myopic cyclorefraction
                        ALWAYS: cyclorefract
                            during any pediatric EUA
                    ASUS for long AL
            portable slitlamp exam // the operating microscope may be adequate
                Haab striae
                    horizontal breaks in the Descemet membrane
                Koeppe direct gonioscopy
                    anterior iris insertion OR
                    Barkan membrane
                        abnormal angle tissue
                        obscures the CB band
                        NOTE: TM is not usually visible
                            even in healthy infants
                rule out anterior segment dysgenesis
            BIO exam
                cupping
                    sometimes reversible
        poor response to medical therapy
            OK to temporize medically
            may help clear the cornea
                typically
                    start with latanoprost 0.005% OR timolol 0.5% as monotherapy
                        timolol is the drug with the longest track record
                            kids 3- YO use timolol 0.25%
                        betaxolol is a theoretically better choice in kids with asthma
                            reduced beta2 blockade
                    add CAI if control is poor
                        brinzolamide
                        dorzolamide
                beta blockers
                    watch for bradycardia or hypotension
                prostaglandins
                    latanoprost is probably equal to timolol in efficacy for kids
                    very good safety profile in children
                    watch for inflammation
                systemic CAI can be added to topical
                    Diamox 10–20 mg/kg/d
                    watch for hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis
        surgery
            can be done at the same time as EUA
            goniotomy if the cornea is clear
                50+% successful on the first try
                    some surgeons claim as much as 80%
                4+ CH if you can
            trabeculotomy if the cornea is cloudy
                scleral flap access
                trabeculotome
                180° to start
                    some surgeons do full 360 with an illuminated microcatheter
            traditional glaucoma surgery
                only in kids who don't respond to a couple of angle surgeries
        as always with kids
            keep the refraction up to date throughout treatment
                if increasing myopia
                    repeat EUA
                    check IOP
            treat any amblyopia
            counsel parents
        if undertreated you will see progression of
            corneal scarring
            cupping
            axial myopia
            amblyopia
        end stage
            lens subluxation
            blindness
        counseling parents about genetics
            when 1 child is affected
                1/20 subsequent siblings will have PCG
            when 2 children are affected
                1/4 subsequent siblings will have PCG

    AD JOAG
        related to MYOC just like adult POAG
        presents older than 4 y
        normal-sized eye and cornea
        no Haab striae
        JOAG is more like POAG than PCG
            exception: JOAG often requires surgery
            still try medical therapy first

    brimonidine (!)
        can cause CNS + respiratory depression
        NEVER: use brimonidine in kids under 2
        use it with caution in older kids

    amblyopia
        both PCG AND early-onset JOAG are at risk
        monitor for
            changing refractive error
            strabismus

                usually diagnose microphthalmos or nanophthalmos because of microcornea
                    9- mm @ birth
                    10- mm @ 2 YO
                    may be easiest to think of both ends in terms of ranges

                may need lens extraction for chronic PACG
                    very difficult in a shallow chamber
                    may need a posterior approach
