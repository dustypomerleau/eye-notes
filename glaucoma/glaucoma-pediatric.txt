pediatric glaucoma

  primary congenital glaucoma
    COMMON: sporadic
    RARELY: AR
    related to
      LTBP2
      CYP1B1
      consanguinity
    epiphora
    photophobia
    blepharospasm
    ALWAYS: EUA
      non-inhalational induction if possible
        ketamine
      elevated IOP
        check quickly at induction
        will decrease under GA
      increased horizontal corneal diameter
        11.5+ mm at birth
        12.5+ mm at 1 y
          in practice
            11+ in the first year
            13+ at any age
          may be easiest to think of both ends in terms of ranges
            normal
              birth 9–11
              1+ years old 10–13
        ± corneal clouding
      buphthalmos
        a bluish hue can tip you off if the sclera is stretched thin
        quantify
          myopic cyclorefraction
            ALWAYS: cyclorefract
              during any pediatric EUA
          ASUS for long AL
      portable slitlamp exam // the operating microscope may be adequate
        Haab striae
          horizontal breaks in the Descemet membrane
        Koeppe direct gonioscopy
          anterior iris insertion OR
          Barkan membrane
            abnormal angle tissue
            obscures the CB band
            NOTE: TM is not usually visible
              even in healthy infants
        rule out anterior segment dysgenesis
      BIO exam
        cupping
          sometimes reversible
    poor response to medical therapy
      OK to temporize medically
      may help clear the cornea
        typically
          start with latanoprost 0.005% OR timolol 0.5% as monotherapy
            timolol is the drug with the longest track record
              kids 3- YO use timolol 0.25%
            betaxolol is a theoretically better choice in kids with asthma
              reduced beta2 blockade
          add CAI if control is poor
            brinzolamide
            dorzolamide
        beta blockers
          watch for bradycardia or hypotension
        prostaglandins
          latanoprost is probably equal to timolol in efficacy for kids
          very good safety profile in children
          watch for inflammation
        systemic CAI can be added to topical
          Diamox 10–20 mg/kg/d
          watch for hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis
    surgery
      can be done at the same time as EUA
      goniotomy if the cornea is clear
        50+% successful on the first try
          some surgeons claim as much as 80%
        4+ CH if you can
      trabeculotomy if the cornea is cloudy
        scleral flap access
        trabeculotome
        180˚ to start
          some surgeons do full 360 with an illuminated microcatheter
      traditional glaucoma surgery
        only in kids who don't respond to a couple of angle surgeries
    as always with kids
      keep the refraction up to date throughout treatment
        if increasing myopia
          repeat EUA
          check IOP
      treat any amblyopia
      counsel parents
    if undertreated you will see progression of
      corneal scarring
      cupping
      axial myopia
      amblyopia
    end stage
      lens subluxation
      blindness
    counseling parents about genetics
      when 1 child is affected
        1/20 subsequent siblings will have PCG
      when 2 children are affected
        1/4 subsequent siblings will have PCG

  AD JOAG
    related to MYOC just like adult POAG
    presents older than 4 y
    normal-sized eye and cornea
    no Haab striae
    JOAG is more like POAG than PCG
      exception: JOAG often requires surgery
      still try medical therapy first

  brimonidine (!)
    can cause CNS + respiratory depression
    NEVER: use brimonidine in kids under 2
    use it with caution in older kids

  amblyopia
    both PCG AND early-onset JOAG are at risk
    monitor for
      changing refractive error
      strabismus

      microphthalmos
        malformed eye

        usually diagnose microphthalmos or nanophthalmos because of microcornea
          9- mm @ birth
          10- mm @ 2 YO
          may be easiest to think of both ends in terms of ranges
            normal
              birth 9–11
              1+ years old 10–13
        may need lens extraction for chronic PACG
          very difficult in a shallow chamber
          may need a posterior approach
