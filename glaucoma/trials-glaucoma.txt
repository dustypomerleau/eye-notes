classic glaucoma trials

  GLT (1990)
    ALT was better than timolol as an initial therapy
      better control
      better durability
      fewer supplementary drops
    study predates other drops
      prostaglandins
      CAI
      alpha-2 agonists
    so we still use drops first

  AGIS (1998)
    looked at patients who had already failed drops
    ATT versus TAT
    blacks did better when ALT was used first
    whites did better going straight to trab
    consistent IOP 18- prevented progression
      "18 and under, blacks @ white tats"

  CNTGS (1998)
    lowering IOP 30% helps even in NTG
      not allowed
        beta blockers
        adrenergic agonists
          concern for confounding cardiovascular effects
        systemic CAI
          would have interfered with the fellow eye control
      allowed
        Xalatan (1996+)
        topical CAIs
        ALT
        surgery
    worse prognosis in NTG
      female sex
      migraine OR Raynaud
      disc haemorrhage
      NOT Asian
        slower progression in Asians
          not many blacks in the study
          mostly compared to whites
          the few blacks included had rapid progression consistent with OHTS

  CIGTS (2001)
    drops versus trab
      rescue ALT OK in both groups
    trab
      lowered the IOP more
      had many more adverse events
        including high rates of CEIOL
    neither group had significant HVF progression
    can't use a fixed % IOP reduction as your goal
      it will undertreat those who start with a high IOP or advanced disease

  OHTS (2002)
    dropping the IOP below 24 cut the risk of glaucoma in half
    confirmed CNTGS finding that disc haemorrhage indicates faster progression
    ALT increases cataract
    risk factors
      age
      male sex
      African American race
      ischaemic heart disease
      IOP
      thin CCT
        average 575 µm
        OHTS risk increased at 555- µm
      VCDR > HCDR
      higher HVF PSD
    CCT 555- & IOP 24+ is a high risk group
      treat aggressively
    key stats
      for CCT 555-
        POAG developed over 5 years in
          1/3 of IOP 26+
          1/8 of IOP 24+
          1/4 of VCDR 0.3+
        numbers are much lower in normal CCT

  EMGT (2002)
    ALT + betaxolol lowered IOP by 25% compared to observation
    treatment cut progression by 1/3 compared to observation
      nearly 1/2 of patients still progressed
    confirmed OHTS finding that ALT increases cataract
    risk factors
      age
      IOP
      bilateral disease
      higher HVF PSD
      PXF

  LoGTS (2011)
    Does brimonidine's neuroprotection make it better than timolol in NTG?
    brimonidine reduced progression in NTG compared to timolol
      VF progression
        1/10+ of the brimonidine group
        1/3+ of the timolol group
    but brimonidine wasn't well tolerated
      dropouts
        1/4+ of the brimonidine group
        1/10+ of the timolol group
    VF progression did not correlate with IOP in NTG
      asymmetric VF progression did not match statistically with asymmetric IOP


  summary of risk factors and factors influencing progression:

    FH
      not confirmed by OHTS but smaller studies support this

    age
    black race
    sex
      male sex
        POAG
          OHTS
      female sex
        NTG
          CNTGS

    ischaemic heart disease
    vasospasm
      migraine
      Raynaud
    OSA

    CCT 555-
      ± low hysteresis
        thin corneas correlate with low hysteresis
        unclear whether low hysteresis is a separate risk factor from thinness
        hysteresis is a measure of elasticity and ability to absorb energy
          higher hysteresis means greater ability to dissipate an applied load
        normal hysteresis is about 10 mm Hg
          studies have shown patients with progressive GON averaging in the 7s
          too early to really say what's pathologic
        low hysteresis patients *seem* to get greater % IOP reduction per drop
          probably an artifact
        patients with high hysteresis
          probably responding better than we can measure
    IOP 24+
    PXF
    VCDR > HCDR
    disc haemorrhage
    bilateral disease
