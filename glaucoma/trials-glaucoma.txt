classic glaucoma trials

    GLT (1990)
        ALT was better than timolol as an initial therapy
            better control
            better durability
            fewer supplementary drops
        NOTE: study predates other drops
            prostaglandins
            CAI
            alpha-2 agonists
        so we still use drops first

    AGIS (1998)
        looked at patients who had already failed drops
        ATT versus TAT
        blacks did better when ALT was used first
        whites did better going straight to trab
        consistent IOP 18- prevented progression
            '18 and under, blacks @ white tats'

    CNTGS (1998)
        lowering IOP 30% helps even in NTG
            allowed
                Xalatan (1996+)
                topical CAIs
                ALT
                surgery
            not allowed
                beta blockers
                adrenergic agonists
                    concern for confounding cardiovascular effects
                systemic CAI
                    would have interfered with the fellow eye control
        worse prognosis in NTG
            female sex
            migraine OR Raynaud
            disc hemorrhage
            NOT Asian
                slower progression in Asians
                    not many blacks in the study
                    mostly compared to whites
                    the few blacks included had rapid progression consistent with OHTS

    CIGTS (2001)
        drops versus trab
            rescue ALT OK in both groups
        trab
            lowered the IOP more
            had many more adverse events
                including high rates of CEIOL
        neither group had significant HVF progression
        can't use a fixed % IOP reduction as your goal
            it will undertreat those who start with a high IOP or advanced disease

    OHTS (2002)
        dropping the IOP below 24 cut the risk of glaucoma in half
        confirmed CNTGS finding that disc hemorrhage indicates faster progression
        ALT increases cataract
        risk factors
            age
            male sex
            African American race
            ischemic heart disease
            IOP
            thin CCT
                average 575 µm
                OHTS risk increased at 555- µm
            VCDR > HCDR
            higher HVF PSD
        CCT 555- & IOP 24+ is a high risk group
            treat aggressively
        key stats
            for CCT 555-
                POAG developed over 5 years in
                    1/3 for IOP 26+
                    1/8 for IOP 24+
                    1/4 for VCDR 0.3+
                numbers are much lower in normal CCT

    EMGT (2002)
        ALT + betaxolol lowered IOP by 25% compared to observation
        treatment cut progression by 1/3 compared to observation
            nearly 1/2 of patients still progressed
        confirmed OHTS finding that ALT increases cataract
        risk factors
            age
            IOP
            bilateral disease
            higher HVF PSD
            PXF

    LoGTS (2011)
        Does brimonidine's neuroprotection make it better than timolol in NTG?
        brimonidine reduced progression in NTG compared to timolol
            VF progression
                1/10+ of the brimonidine group
                1/3+ of the timolol group
        but brimonidine wasn't well tolerated
            dropouts
                1/4+ of the brimonidine group
                1/10+ of the timolol group
        VF progression did not correlate with IOP in NTG
            asymmetric VF progression did not match statistically with asymmetric IOP

summary of risk factors and factors influencing progression:

    FH
        not confirmed by OHTS but smaller studies support this

    age
    black race
    sex
        male sex
            POAG (OHTS)
        female sex
            NTG (CNTGS)

    ischemic heart disease
    vasospasm
        migraine
        Raynaud
    OSA

    CCT 555-
        ± low hysteresis
            thin corneas correlate with low hysteresis
            unclear whether low hysteresis is a separate risk factor from thinness
            hysteresis is a measure of elasticity and ability to absorb energy
                higher hysteresis means greater ability to dissipate an applied load
            normal hysteresis is about 10 mm Hg
                studies have shown patients with progressive GON averaging in the 7s
                too early to really say what's pathologic
            low hysteresis patients *seem* to get greater % IOP reduction per drop
                probably an artifact
            patients with high hysteresis
                probably responding better than we can measure
