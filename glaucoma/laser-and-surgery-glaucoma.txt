glaucoma laser

    LTP
        mechanism unclear
            increased TM permeability
            cytokine mediated at the cellular level
        max ~ 25% reduction in IOP
        success ~ 75% for ALT and SLT
        only about half will be controlled without drops
        avoid LTP in
            angle scarring or membranes
                PAS
                angle recession
                anterior segment dysgenesis

        ALT // now superseded by SLT
            pretreatment
                apraclonidine 0.5%
            argon 532 nm laser
                Ritch LTP lens
                50 µm spot size
                100 ms duration
                400–1000 mW
                    increase intensity until blanching or a small bubble forms
                placed @ junction of pigmented and nonpigmented trabecular meshwork
                ~ 50 burns per 180°
                    3 burn-widths apart
            postoperative
                apraclonidine 0.5% immediately after treatment
            IOP check
                1–3 hours
                POD 1
            topical steroid
                qid x 4–7 days
            re-evaluation
                1 week
                6 weeks
            complications:
                elevated IOP
                progressive visual field loss
                PAS formation
                iritis
                pain
                potential decreased success of future filtering procedures

        SLT
            optional pretreatment
                apraclonidine 0.5%
            532 nm YAG // for example Ellex Tango
                Latina LTP lens
                fixed 400 µm spot size
                fixed 0.3 ns duration
                aiming beam will not be in sharp focus
                burns overlap the entire TM
                titrate energy
                    below the threshold for bubbling and blanching
                        pigmented angles
                            0.3+ mJ
                        nonpigmented angles
                            0.8+ mJ
                ~ 50 confluent burns per 180°
                    many studies use a range of 60–80 spots/treatment
            360 treatment
                compared to 180
                    drops IOP more
                    higher incidence of IOP spikes
                        particularly in pigmentary glaucoma or heavy pigmented angles
            postoperative
                NSAIDs OR a mild steroid
                    qid x 5 days
                    may improve IOP outcomes @ 12 weeks
                        SALT trial
            25+% reduction @ 3–6 months is an excellent response
            short duration relative to the thermal relaxation time of the tissue
                essentially no thermal damage
                hence the repeatability
            complications
                IOP spikes
                PAS formation
                similar complication numbers to ALT
                thought to be less inflammatory
                    literature has never proven this
            follow-up
                if you're going to treat 180 at a time
                    wait 8 weeks before deciding on the effect of the first 180

glaucoma surgery

    avoid trab with
        NVI
        uveitis
        scarred conj
        thin sclera

    trabeculectomy (fornix-based) // my preference
        7.0 vicryl corneal traction suture
        lift conj with lidocaine
        superior limbal peritomy
            ± radial relaxing incisions
            4 mm scleral flap
                15° blade
                1/2 thickness
                cut the base of the flap only
            dissection with angled crescent
                into clear cornea
            open the sides of the flap with the 15°
        MMC 0.5 mg/mL for 2–5 minutes
            concentration can be varied
                0.3–0.5 mg/mL
                maximum is '0.5 for 5'
            hold the limbal margin of the conj away from the MMC
            remove and irrigate
        paracentesis and deepening of the AC
            ± OVD if needed
            alternative is AC maintainer
        anterior horizontal incision with 15° blade
        enlarge sclerostomy to about 2 mm across with a scleral punch
            1 mm posteriorly is plenty
            more than that risks CB bleeding
        SPI with forceps and iris scissors
        10–0 nylon flap closure
            ± 4-throw adjustable knots
            Khaw technique
                permanent sutures at the corners
                4 x adjustables
                    2 on either side of each permanent suture
        irrigate AC with BSS and check flow
            adjust knots or add sutures as needed
        running/locking conj closure to limbus
            9–0 vicryl
            can recess in a 1/2 thickness corneal groove
            Khaw technique
                small purse string at each corner
                single horizontal x 3 across the middle
                    in through the groove
                    underside to topside
                        ± 1–2 pursestring bites for corners
                    topside to underside
                    out through the groove
        seidel to ensure closure is watertight
        deepen AC
        remove traction suture

    Baerveldt (Ahmed similar without tucking under muscles)
        7.0 vicryl corneal traction suture
        limbal peritomy in quadrant of your choice
            usually ST
        isolate rectus muscles with muscle hook
        place plate in position beneath muscles
        suture plate to sclera
        tie off tube
            7–0 vicryl
            2 mm from the plate OR
            'rip-cord' suture
        cut tube
            bevel up
            4 mm beyond the limbus
        paracentesis and deepen the AC
            ± OVD if needed
        enter AC at the limbus with a 23–25 g needle
        pass tube into AC
        suture to sclera
            couple of 9–0 nylon stitches
        fenestrate the anterior portion of the tube at several points
        cover with scleral patch graft
            anchor graft with 10–0 nylon
        close conjunctiva
            running/locking closure
            9–0 vicryl
        seidel to ensure closure is watertight
        deepen AC
        remove traction suture

    combined surgery
        may decrease success rates
        high-risk patients
            filtering surgery alone
            subsequent CEIOL
