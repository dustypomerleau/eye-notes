glaucoma laser

  LTP
    mechanism unclear
      increased TM permeability
      cytokine mediated at the cellular level
    max ~ 25% reduction in IOP
    success ~ 75% for ALT and SLT
    only about half will be controlled without drops
    avoid LTP in
      angle scarring or membranes
        PAS
        angle recession
        anterior segment dysgenesis
        ICE
      inflammatory glaucoma
      NVA

    ALT // now superseded by SLT
      pretreatment
        apraclonidine 0.5%
      argon 532 nm laser
        Ritch LTP lens
        50 µm spot size
        100 ms duration
        400-1000 mW
          increase intensity until blanching or a small bubble forms
        placed @ junction of pigmented and nonpigmented trabecular meshwork
        ~ 50 burns per 180˚
          3 burn-widths apart
      postoperative
        apraclonidine 0.5% immediately after treatment
      IOP check
        1-3 hours
        POD 1
      topical steroid
        qid x 4-7 days
      re-evaluation
        1 week
        6 weeks
      complications:
        elevated IOP
        progressive visual field loss
        PAS formation
        iritis
        pain
        potential decreased success of future filtering procedures

    SLT
      optional pretreatment
        apraclonidine 0.5%
      532 nm YAG // for example Ellex Tango
        Latina LTP lens
        fixed 400 µm spot size
        fixed 0.3 ns duration
        aiming beam will not be in sharp focus
        burns overlap the entire TM
        titrate energy
          below the threshold for bubbling and blanching
            pigmented angles
              0.3+ mJ
            nonpigmented angles
              0.8+ mJ
        ~ 50 confluent burns per 180˚
      360 treatment
        compared to 180
          drops IOP more
          higher incidence of IOP spikes
            particularly in pigmentary glaucoma OR heavy pigmented angles
      postoperative
        NSAIDs OR a mild steroid
      25+% reduction @ 3-6 months is an excellent response
      short duration relative to the thermal relaxation time of the tissue
        essentially no thermal damage
        hence the repeatability
      complications
        IOP spikes
        PAS formation
        similar complication numbers to ALT
        thought to be less inflammatory
          literature has never proven this
      follow-up
        if you're going to treat 180 at a time
          wait 8 weeks before deciding on the effect of the first 180

glaucoma surgery

  avoid trab with
    NVI
    uveitis
    scarred conj
    thin sclera

  trabeculectomy (fornix-based) // my preference
    7.0 vicryl corneal traction suture
    lift conj with lidocaine
    superior limbal peritomy
      ± radial relaxing incisions
      4 mm scleral flap
        15˚ blade
        1/2 thickness
        cut the base of the flap only
      dissection with angled crescent
        into clear cornea
      open the sides of the flap with the 15˚
    MMC 0.5 mg/mL for 2-5 minutes
      concentration can be varied
        0.3-0.5 mg/mL
        maximum is '0.5 for 5'
      hold the limbal margin of the conj away from the MMC
      remove and irrigate
    paracentesis and deepening of the AC
      ± OVD if needed
      alternative is AC maintainer
    anterior horizontal incision with 15˚ blade
    enlarge sclerostomy to about 2 mm across with a scleral punch
      1 mm posteriorly is plenty
      more than that risks CB bleeding
    SPI with forceps and iris scissors
    10-0 nylon flap closure
      ± 4-throw adjustable knots
      Khaw technique
        permanent sutures at the corners
        4 x adjustables
          2 on either side of each permanent suture
    irrigate AC with BSS and check flow
      adjust knots or add sutures as needed
    running/locking conj closure to limbus
      9-0 vicryl
      can recess in a 1/2 thickness corneal groove
      Khaw technique
        small purse string at each corner
        single horizontal x 3 across the middle
          in through the groove
          underside to topside
            ± 1-2 pursestring bites for corners
          topside to underside
          out through the groove
    seidel to ensure closure is watertight
    deepen AC
    remove traction suture

  Baerveldt (Ahmed similar without tucking under muscles)
    7.0 vicryl corneal traction suture
    limbal peritomy in quadrant of your choice
      usually ST
    isolate rectus muscles with muscle hook
    place plate in position beneath muscles
    suture plate to sclera
    tie off tube
      7-0 vicryl
      2 mm from the plate OR
      'rip-cord' suture
    cut tube
      bevel up
      4 mm beyond the limbus
    paracentesis and deepen the AC
      ± OVD if needed
    enter AC at the limbus with a 23-25 g needle
    pass tube into AC
    suture to sclera
      couple of 9-0 nylon stitches
    fenestrate the anterior portion of the tube at several points
    cover with scleral patch graft
      anchor graft with 10-0 nylon
    close conjunctiva
      running/locking closure
      9-0 vicryl
    seidel to ensure closure is watertight
    deepen AC
    remove traction suture

  combined surgery
    may decrease success rates
    high-risk patients
      filtering surgery alone
      subsequent CEIOL

postop management

flat AC after trabeculectomy
  ask about
    eye rubbing
    trauma
    straining
      lifting
      constipation
    gush of fluid
  determine
    low IOP
    high IOP
  run DDx for each
    seidel
    exam
      surgical emergencies
        central IK touch
        lens-K touch
  adjust medications
  temporizing measures
    e.g. scleral CTL
  minor surgical interventions
  complete reoperations
    if endothelial contact
      operate early to save the cornea

low IOP after trabeculectomy
  stop any glaucoma drops
  shield
  avoid lifting or straining
  // NOTE: for exams, not all of below are relevant in a flat AC
  overfiltration
    look for loose flap sutures
      especially adjustables
    don't gonio a soft eye until you've ruled out a leak
    if early after surgery
      reduce steroids to help scarring
    atropine
    limbus-to-fornix Palmberg sutures
      limits bleb size
    transconjunctival scleral flap sutures
    autologous blood patch
    AC OVD to temporize
    bleb revision with new flap sutures
  bleb leak
    2% fluorescein minims to identify
    if early after surgery
      reduce steroids to help scarring
    ofloxacin cover
    atropine
    aqueous suppressants
      NOTE: aqueous suppressants are OK in a leak but not overfiltration
    doxycycline to inhibit MMPs
    scleral CTL
    fibrin glue
    autologous blood patch
    AC OVD to temporizes
    conjunctival graft OR
    full bleb revision
  wound leak
  cyclodialysis cleft
  RRD
  serous suprachoroidal effusion
  reduced aqueous production
    medication-induced decrease in aqueous production
    CB shutdown // a vague entity that should be low on your DDx
  counsel the patient
    hypotony increases the risk of blebitis OR endophthalmitis
  hypotony maculopathy
    choroidal folds
    OCT helps to distinguish folds from CME

high IOP after trabeculectomy
  // NOTE: for exams, not all of below are relevant in a flat AC
  tight flap sutures
  scarring
    conjunctiva
    flap
    sclerostomy
  blocked sclerostomy // AC usually deep
    OVD
    fibrin
    blood
    iris
  trabecular outflow obstruction
    AC inflammation
      sterile
      infectious
        endophthalmitis
        blebitis
    retained OVD
    hyphema
    spillover VH
    angle closure
      PAS
