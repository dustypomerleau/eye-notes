optic nerve and RNFL imaging
    HRT
        SLO
        surface map
        estimates NFL thickness based on chosen floor
        tracks progression
    GDx
        SLP
        measures phase shift of light by NFL
        good relative measurements
        poor at absolute measurement
        good progression tracking
        picks up small NFL defects
        susceptible to artifact
    OCT
        most accurate absolute NFL measurement
        best normative database
            for whites (!)
        better progression now because of SDOCT tracking via SLO

perimetry
    SWAP
        BoY
        tests dedicated ganglion cells for short wavelengths
        their receptive fields are large and don't overlap
        short wavelength VF defects can appear after losing a small number of axons
        makes SWAP sensitive for early glaucoma
        ALWAYS: consider SWAP in patients with many risk factors and a normal HVF
    FDT
        preferentially activates M cells
        good at catching early glaucoma
        terrible for following progression
    HVF
        check reliability
            FL
            FP
            FN
        mean difference map measures average sensitivity loss
        PSD highlights localized loss
            very complex formula but the concept is not complex
                BROADLY: involves the SD of the set of numbers resulting from
                    (threshold at each point - value in age-matched controls)
                /*
                SD: the sqrt of the mean of the squared differences between the members and their mean
                */
        hemifield analysis points out discrepancies above and below the midline
            common in glaucoma
        total deviation map
            compares the threshold at each point to age-matched normals
        pattern deviation probability map
            (threshold at each point - average threshold for all points) -
                (same calc at that point for age-matched controls)
            helps compensate for generalized depression
                e.g. cataract
        GHT
            good for initial diagnosis of glaucoma
            primarily compares points above and below the midline
            tuned for glaucomatous patterns
        GCP
            probability of progression for a given point
            based on a comparison of pattern deviation probability maps
        signs of glaucoma on a HVF
            pattern deviation probability plot
                cluster of 3+ depressed points
                at least one of the depressed points has a P 1-%
            abnormal GHT
            PSD with P 5-%
                *repeatable* on consecutive tests
