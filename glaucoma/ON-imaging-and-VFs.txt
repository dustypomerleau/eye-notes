optic nerve and RNFL imaging
  HRT
    SLO
    surface map
    estimates NFL thickness based on chosen floor
    tracks progression
  GDx
    SLP
    measures phase shift of light by NFL
    good relative measurements
    poor at absolute measurement
    good progression tracking
    picks up small NFL defects
    susceptible to artifact
  OCT
    most accurate absolute NFL measurement
    best normative database
      for whites
    better progression now because of SDOCT tracking via SLO

perimetry
  SWAP
    BoY
    tests dedicated ganglion cells for short wavelengths
    their receptive fields are large and don't overlap
    short wavelength VF defects can appear after losing a small number of axons
    makes SWAP sensitive for early glaucoma
    ALWAYS: mention SWAP in questions about glaucoma risk with a normal HVF
  FDT
    preferentially activates M cells
    good at catching early glaucoma
    terrible for following progression
  HVF
    check reliability
      FL
      FP
      FN
    mean difference map measures average sensitivity loss
    PSD highlights localized loss
      very complex formula but the concept is not complex
        BROADLY: involves the SD of the set of numbers resulting from
        (threshold at each point - value in age-matched controls)
    hemifield analysis points out discrepancies above and below the midline
      common in glaucoma
    total deviation map
      compares the threshold at each point to age-matched normals
    pattern deviation probability map
      (threshold at each point - average threshold for all points) -
        (same calc at that point for age-matched controls)
      helps compensate for generalised depression
        e.g. cataract
    GHT
      good for initial diagnosis of glaucoma
      primarily compares points above and below the midline
      tuned for glaucomatous patterns
    GCP
      probability of progression for a given point
      based on a comparison of pattern deviation probability maps
    signs of glaucoma on a HVF
      pattern deviation probability plot
        cluster of 3+ depressed points
        at least one of the depressed points has a P 1-%
      abnormal GHT
      PSD with P 5-%
        *repeatable* on consecutive tests
