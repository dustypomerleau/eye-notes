age-appropriate visual acuity testing

  if there is no amblyopia we expect at LEAST
    6/60 by 6 months
    6/15 by 3 years // many children are 6/6 by PL @ 3 years
    6/12 by 5 years
    method of testing is important
      pattern VEP shows better VA than PL in infants
      generally, the further you go down the list
        the lower the measured acuity will be
        i.e. PL, Lea tend to overestimate VA compared to ETDRS

amblyopia != suppression
  you can have suppression of an eye with 6/6 vision
  suppression is only present when using both eyes
  amblyopia is present all the time

good outcome of amblyopia therapy
  6/9 vision
  straight eyes
  by 10 YO

PEDIG summary
  moderate amblyopes 6/24+
    atropine 1% bd 2 days/week OR
    2 h patching
  severe amblyopes 6/30-
    patch up to 6 h
    no benefit to more than that
  actual studies
    moderate amblyopes
      7- YO
        daily atropine = 6 (2002)
        2 = 6 (2003)
        2 days (weekend) atropine = daily atropine
        3/4 7- YO moderates achieve 6/9 OR gain 3 lines
          biggest improvement is in the first 6 weeks
      7–12 YO
        2 days atropine = 2 (2008)
          1/5 achieves 6/7.5 in this age group
          size of gain is much smaller
            average gain is a little more than a line
          younger patients get more benefit
    severe amblyopes
      7- YO
        6 = full-time (2003)
          4/5 gain 3 lines
          1/4 achieve 6/9
      3–12 YO
        2 days atropine = 2 (2009)
          average gain was 1–2 lines
          nearly all patients were 6/15- despite this
            so better to use 6 hours patching OR daily atropine in 6/30-

MOTAS amblyopia study (2004)
  patching has a dose-response effect
  only half of patients are compliant with patching
  the greatest effect of patching is in the first few weeks
  treatment age is a major factor in the success of patching

VIP-HIP study (2016)
  preschoolers with 3–6 D hyperopia versus emmetropic preschoolers
    moderate hyperopes had
      lower VA
      worse stereo
      // prior studies also documented higher amblyopia and strabismus
  even when they can accomodate through the hyperopia
    3+ D should be corrected
      even if the 2 eyes are similar
  general practice pattern
    tolerate slightly more hyperopia in 1–2 YO
      4–5 D
    if there is strabismus at any value of hyperopia
      correct the hyperopia

review amblyopes
  1–3 months depending on
    amblyopia severity
    age
      see sooner if
        younger
        better visual potential
        more dense amblyopia
  stop therapy
    3 visits with no improvement
  expectations
    3/4 of moderate amblyopes gain 3 lines in 6 months
      many will be faster than this
    1/4 will have recurrence over the first year
      to prevent recurrence
        wean slowly
          alternate days first
          then reduce hours
    older kids
      still worth patching
        1/2 will improve age 7–12
        1/4 will improve age 13–17
  if amblyopia therapy doesn't work
    talk compliance
    repeat the refraction
    repeat the fundus exam

  risk of poor outcome in amblyopes
    strong FH of amblyopia
    dense amblyopia at diagnosis
    treatment started late
    not compliant
      including behavioral problems
    poor family support

cover testing
  first without glasses
  then with glasses
  make the diagnosis with cover-uncover
  then quantify with prism + alternate cover

  cover-uncover
    perform in 5 positions at 6 m
    then in 1°'
    this is really 2 tests
      cover
        watch fellow eye
          is there a tropia?
            yes
              is there a fixation preference?
                both eyes are briefly exposed between cover tests
                look for the eye that doesn't move when the fellow is covered
      uncover
        watch covered eye
          is there a phoria?
          is there a DVD?
    record each measurement as you go along
    for ET OR XT
      STATE if the angle is worse at near OR distance
      write this down
    write down top 3+ diagnoses at this point
      decide what other information you need to prove/disprove them

    if the deviation is incomitant and you suspect a palsy
      check
        1° deviation
          good eye fixating
        2° deviation

      endpoint is no movement
    1°
    1°'
    4 gazes
    may not need this test on the OSCE
      generally you wouldn't operate on this angle
      usually you would operate on the maximum angle
        determined by prism + alternate cover

  (prism + alternate cover)
    quantify the maximum deviation
      some describe this as phoria + tropia
      really it's just semantics
    1°
    1°'
    4 gazes

    useful for measuring DVD

/*
prism technique
  hold prisms correctly
    glass
      Prentice position
    plastic
      frontal plane
  don't follow the turned head
  hold prism over the adducting eye in XT side-gaze measurements
  OK to hold H + V together
    do not stack back to back in the same orientation
      split between the eyes
  ALWAYS:
    confirm that the eye is not motionless due to restriction
    confirm patient is looking at the target.
  measure intermittent deviations after 45 minutes of patching
    to ensure you get the maximum angle
*/

test ductions and versions

  ductions are the key
    are they normal?
      if there is a limitation
        restrictive OR
        paretic
    document -1 to -4
      ± upshoots or downshoots
      (+1)-(+4) can be redundant if you've documented upshoots/downshoots
        but as always there are some fanboys that love them
      grading
        unable to move from 1° (-4)
        unable to make it 1/4 of the way into the field of gaze (-3)
        unable to make it 1/2 of the way into the field of gaze (-2)
        sclera is just visible (-1)
        sclera is concealed by the canthus (0)
        cornea is slightly covered (+1)
        cornea is covered less than 1/4 (+2)
        cornea is covered more than 1/4 (+3)
        cornea is 1/2+ covered (+4)
    version < duction
      underaction or palsy
      floating stop
    version == duction
      restrictive strabismus
      hard stop
    if you see a limitation
      saccadic velocity
        slow in paretic
      forced ductions
        ALWAYS: mention forced ductions if you suspect Brown syndrome
          technically required to diagnose a Brown
          in practice this is only done if you go to OT for surgery
    look for oblique dysfunction // see notes on infantile ET above

            5–11 mm each eye corrects 20–50 ∆
              '520 to 1150'
        numbers are similar for combining R & R in one eye
      adjustable sutures
        only use adjustables on recessions
        plan to adjust them within 24 hours
      most common reason for postop dissatisfaction
        diplopia that wasn't present before
          synoptophore gives some indication of binocular potential
          true postop diplopia test is a better predictor
            key point about the postop diplopia test
              it's for patients that do NOT have diplopia preop
            allows more adaptation time
            methods for postop diplopia test
              fresnel prisms
              BOTOX
                try BOTOX even if prisms failed
                  prisms over-call postop diplopia
                wait 6 months after BOTOX before measuring angles for surgery
      incision types
        limbal
          easy for the surgeon
          less comfortable postop for the patient
          better for
            access to rectus muscles
            patients over 40
              conjunctival restriction can play a role in adult strabismus
        fornix
          ~ 8 mm back
          between the muscles in the white space
          better for kids
            even for rectus surgery
          better for oblique surgery
            exposure is better
            use for oblique surgery regardless of age
        swan
          back like a fornix but right over the muscle
          easier for vertical rectus access
          can scar to the muscle insertion
          some surgeons split the difference for vertical recti
            go halfway between swan and fornix
      to reduce postop pain
        keep conj incisions out of the palpebral fissure
        bury conjunctival knots
          usually 8–0 vicryl in AU
        protect the cornea
        give subconj LA at the conclusion of the case
      surgical complications
        perforation and all related sequelae
          endophthalmitis
          vitreous hemorrhage
          retinal detachment
          choroidal or suprachoroidal hemorrhage
        anterior segment ischemia
          ciliary arteries pass through the rectus muscles
          interrupting 3+ muscles can induce ASI
          signs
            corneal edema
            anterior uveitis
            rubeosis
              severe ASI can cause NVG
        postoperative strabismus
          undercorrection OR overcorrection
          consecutive strabismus
            including slipped or lost muscle
              complete paresis in the direction of action on POD1
              reduced saccadic velocity in the direction of action
              ALWAYS:
                suture the muscle belly
                  not just the sheath
                double-lock your sutures
              if the muscle is slipped on POD1
                operate to retrieve it ASAP
                  before contracture
                hand-over-hand lifting of the Tenon capsule
                  muscle should follow
              if you can't retrieve the muscle
                transposition surgery
          adherence syndrome
            violation of Tenon
            prolapse of orbital fat
            fibrofatty scar
            restrictive strabismus
            COMMON: hypotropia after IO surgery
          induced Brown syndrome
            from operating around the trochlea
        induced astigmatism
          WTR can occur after operating on LR and MR in the same eye
          usually resolves
        postoperative amblyopia
        postoperative diplopia
        altered lid position
          COMMON: LL retraction after IR recession
        orbital cellulitis
        Tenon prolapse
          suture conj only
            avoid suturing Tenon
          close wound completely
          can require excision if severe
          fornix incisions may reduce Tenon prolapse
        suture reactions
          granuloma
          scleritis
          allergy
        dellen
    occlusion
