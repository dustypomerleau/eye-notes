vertical strabismus

// see strabismus.txt

four rules for vertical strabismus
    CN4P unless proven otherwise
    CN4P are congenital unless proven otherwise
    CN4P are usually traumatic if not congenital
    if a vertical strabismus is not congenital or traumatic CN4P
        investigate

CN4P
    children
        usually have AHP
            sit them up straight
            document
                head tilt
                face turn
                chin up or down
                    will tilt and turn away from the palsy
        CN4P in kids is not really an innervation problem
            most have a lax SO tendon when you do forced ductions in OT
    adults
        middle-aged patient
        intermittent diplopia
            longstanding CN4P
                AHP present in old photos
                vertical fusional amplitude 3+ ∆
        traumatic cases
            significant inciting event
            much more torsion than congenital cases
                limit of tolerance is about 10°
                    measure
                        double maddox rods
                        synoptophore
    BHTT
        negative BHTT does not rule out CN4P
        CN4P is THE cause of vertical strabismus
    CN4P DDx
        COMMON: congenital >> traumatic > ALSO: microvascular > RARELY: tumor
        prism fusion range can help distinguish // see OSCE notes
    bilateral CN4P
        complain of difficulty reading more than diplopia
        not common
        consider if
            alternating HT
            history of trauma
            10+° excyclotorsion on DMR
            V pattern ET 25+ ∆ in downgaze
                look for chin down posture
    to rule out CN4P in the setting of CN3P
        look for torsion
    when to image a CN4P
        other CNP
        progressively worse
        nystagmus
        papilledema
    surgery
        COMMON: IO weakening
            myotomy
            myectomy
            anterior transposition
            maximum 20 ∆
                if you need more
                    fellow eye IR recession
                        conservative amount
                        effect increases with time
                        risk of LL retraction
                    SR recession // RARE
                        only good for comitant cases
                        most are not comitant
        to address AHP
            SO tuck
                risk of an induced Brown syndrome
        to address torsion primarily
            Harada-Ito
                split the SO down the middle
                transpose the anterior half forward
                    as far as the SR insertion allows
                can combine HI with fellow eye SO tuck
                    to correct large torsions
                    to correct a large HT in 1°
                    SO tuck has a risk of an induced Brown syndrome

    5 syndromes of CN4P
        nuclear OR fascicular CN4P
            midbrain
                trauma
                hemorrhage
                infarction
                demyelination
            sympathetics pass through here
                may have a contralateral Horner syndrome
        subarachnoid space
            where CN4 exits the dorsal midbrain
                trauma
                    contracoup forces from the edge of the tentorium
                    often the site in bilateral CN4P
                pinealoma
                meningioma
                meningitis
        cavernous sinus CN4P
            // covered extensively below in CN3P
            it's hard to check CN4 function when there is a CN3P
                SO can't be tested because you can't adduct the eye
                turn the head so the eye is abducted
                ask the patient to look down
                observe for intortion to confirm CN4 is intact
        orbital CN4P
            usually other CN are involved and orbital signs are present
        isolated CN4P
            congenital CN4P gets lumped in here even though it's not really a palsy
            if acquired in an adult without a history of trauma
                scan
                    can be ischemic but unlike CN3P you probably shouldn't observe here


//


CN3P
    // a very important exam topic
    // four rules don't apply here
    //   because there is (usually) a significant horizontal component also
    for all CNP
        STATE that you would examine other CN
    partial CN3P
        can present with any strabismus except an ET
            small vertical
            oblique dysfunction
            INO appearance
            ± ptosis
            ± mydriasis
    patients with CN3P need imaging
        MRI + MRA ± gad OR
        noncon CT + contrast CTA
            many institutions do CTA first
                it's fast and available
                noncon CT is great for SAH
                CTA is great for PCA OR basilar aneurysms
                MR is better for tissue pathology
                MR allows you to follow the course of CN3 for other causes
        if the results are uncertain OR suggest PCA aneurysm
            catheter angiography
                often done at the time of planned embolization for PCA aneurysm
                not risk-free
                    can have CVA during balloon occlusion
                    morbidity 1/100
                    mortality 1/1000
        exception
            complete CN3P
            totally normal pupil
            patient fits ischemic CN3P demographics
            patient has vascular risk factors
            recovery in 3 months
            no signs of aberrant regeneration // see below
        do not rely on pain
            ischemic and aneurysmal palsies can both hurt
        check the pupil again in 1 week
            to ensure the CN3P is not progressive
    ALWAYS: screen for GCA if they are old
    look for aberrant regeneration
        COMMON: lid elevation in downgaze
        ALSO:
            paradoxical eye movement
            pupil constriction with eye movement
        ALWAYS: scan a patient with aberrant regeneration
            clear indicator that the CN3P is not ischemic
        fairly common in congenital CN3P
    recurrent CN3P
        ophthalmoplegic migraine
        DM
        compression
            ethmoidal mucocele
            pituitary adenoma
            IIH
    children
        high amblyopia risk
            top concern after getting the scan is amblyopia
        surgery
            goal is 1° position alignment and no amblyopia
            options
                max LR recession
                detaching LR and fixating to the orbital wall
                large MR resection
                SR + IR traction sutures
                    temporary
                    pass through lid
                    to generate medial scarring
                SO transposition to MR insertion
                ptosis
                    usually poor levator function
                    silicone frontalis sling
                    high risk of postop exposure
                        poor Bell phenomenon
                        limited upgaze
    adults
        if aneurysm present on MRI + MRA
            need clipping or embolization ASAP

    7 syndromes of CN3P
        nuclear CN3P
            RARE
            CN3 nucleus innervates contralateral SR
            unpaired central caudal nucleus innervates both levators
                true nuclear CN3P has
                    bilateral ptosis
                    contralateral eye upgaze paralysis
        CN3 fascicle
            COMMON: ischemic
            many combinations but most are some mix of
                cerebellar peduncle
                    Nothnagel syndrome
                        CN3P + cerebellar ataxia

                cerebral peduncle
                    Weber syndrome
                        CN3P + contralateral hemiparesis
        uncal herniation
            stretches CN3 across the tentorium below the temporal lobe
            often starts as a dilated and fixed pupil
            later progresses to a more complete CN3P
        PCA aneurysm
            COMMON: and important cause of CN3P with a fixed and dilated pupil
            junction of the PCA and ICA
            CN3 passes lateral to this before entering the cavernous sinus
        cavernous sinus CN3P
            CN[345(1|2)6PS]P // see 6 syndromes of CN6P in ET.txt
            COMMON: CN3 aberrant regeneration after cavernous sinus CN3P

        orbital CN3P
            CN3 splits as it enters the SOF

                you can recess the IO to reduce postop IOOA but this isn't common
            surgical indications
                manifest HT in 1°
                AHP
                cosmesis
            don't do surgery if you don't have to
                more than 40% get a relative SO palsy
                    a portion of those may lose binocularity

MED
    HoT in both abduction and adduction
    usually also
        chin up AHP
        ptosis
    NEVER:
        diagnose MED without ruling out
            CN3P
            CCDD
    MED is really a collection of disorders
        some restrictive
        some supranuclear

orbital fracture // see also fractures-orbital.txt

        adults
        floor fractures
    RARELY:

            usually in floor fractures
            upgaze is limited by entrapment

                Faden of fellow eye IR
                    uses of the Faden
                        COMMON:
                            DVD // see ET.txt
                                SR recession boosted by Faden
                            muscle paresis
                                to weaken the fellow eye synergist
                                COMMON: fellow MR in CN6P
                            convergence excess in accomodative ET with high AC/A
                                Faden added to bimedial recessions will boost effect
                            floor fractures
                                limitation of downgaze on the side of fracture causes diplopia
                                Faden to fellow IR
                    use nonabsorbable 6–0 Mersilene braided polyester

                            high risk of perforation
                        risk of vortex vein trauma
                        risk to the orbital fat pad

skew deviation
    normal ocular tilt reaction
        right body tilt induces
        left head tilt
            major aspect of the physiologic OTR
        eyes roll left
            minor aspect of the physiologic OTR
    skew deviation
        HT + pathologic OTR
            HT
                usually comitant
                    BHTT usually negative
            when tilting toward the lower eye
                eyes roll in the direction of tilt
                    much more than in physiologic OTR
            ± torsional jerk nystagmus
                away from a medullary lesion
                toward a midbrain lesion
    anatomic sites
        lateral medullary lesion
            Wallenberg syndrome
            lesion on the side of the low eye

            lesion on the side of the low eye
        MLF
            usually + INO
            lesion on the side of the high eye
        medulla
            lesion can be either side
        RARELY:
            thalamus
            cortex
    skew deviation DDx
        COMMON: brainstem CVA

    exam
        incyclotorsion of the high eye
            opposite of CN4P
        skew deviation almost always has other abnormalities on neurologic exam
    ALWAYS: MRI
        other investigaions depending on what you need to rule out
        remember
            if a vertical is not CN4P -> investigate
