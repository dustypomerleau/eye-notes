vertical strabismus

// see strabismus.txt

four rules for vertical strabismus
  CN4P unless proven otherwise
  CN4P are congenital unless proven otherwise
  CN4P are usually traumatic if not congenital
  if a vertical strabismus is not congenital or traumatic CN4P
    investigate

CN4P
  children
    usually have AHP
      sit them up straight
      document
        head tilt
        face turn
        chin up or down
          will tilt and turn away from the palsy
    CN4P in kids is not really an innervation problem
      most have a lax SO tendon when you do forced ductions in OT
  adults
    middle-aged patient
    intermittent diplopia
      longstanding CN4P
        AHP present in old photos
        vertical fusional amplitude 3+ ∆
    traumatic cases
      significant inciting event
      much more torsion than congenital cases
        limit of tolerance is about 10˚
          measure
            double maddox rods
            synoptophore
  BHTT
    negative BHTT does not rule out CN4P
    CN4P is THE cause of vertical strabismus
  CN4P DDx
    COMMON: congenital >> traumatic > ALSO: microvascular > RARELY: tumor
    prism fusion range can help distinguish // see OSCE notes
  bilateral CN4P
    complain of difficulty reading more than diplopia
    not common
    consider if
      alternating HT
      history of trauma
      10+˚ excyclotorsion on DMR
      V pattern ET 25+ ∆ in downgaze
        look for chin down posture
  to rule out CN4P in the setting of CN3P
    look for torsion
  when to image a CN4P
    other CNP
    progressively worse
    nystagmus
    papilledema
  surgery
    COMMON: IO weakening
      myotomy
      myectomy
      anterior transposition
      maximum 20 ∆
        if you need more
          fellow eye IR recession
            conservative amount
            effect increases with time
            risk of LL retraction
          SR recession // RARE
            only good for comitant cases
            most are not comitant
    to address AHP
      SO tuck
        risk of an induced Brown syndrome
    to address torsion primarily
      Harada-Ito
        split the SO down the middle
        transpose the anterior half forward
          as far as the SR insertion allows
        can combine HI with fellow eye SO tuck
          to correct large torsions
          to correct a large HT in 1˚
          SO tuck has a risk of an induced Brown syndrome

  5 syndromes of CN4P
    nuclear OR fascicular CN4P
      midbrain
        trauma
        hemorrhage
        infarction
        demyelination
      sympathetics pass through here
        may have a contralateral Horner syndrome
    subarachnoid space
      where CN4 exits the dorsal midbrain
        trauma
          contracoup forces from the edge of the tentorium
          often the site in bilateral CN4P
        pinealoma
        meningioma
        meningitis
    cavernous sinus CN4P
      // covered extensively below in CN3P
      it's hard to check CN4 function when there is a CN3P
        SO can't be tested because you can't adduct the eye
        turn the head so the eye is abducted
        ask the patient to look down
        observe for intortion to confirm CN4 is intact
    orbital CN4P
      usually other CN are involved and orbital signs are present
    isolated CN4P
      congenital CN4P gets lumped in here even though it's not really a palsy
      if acquired in an adult without a history of trauma
        scan
          can be ischemic but unlike CN3P you probably shouldn't observe here


//


CN3P
  // a very important exam topic
  // four rules don't apply here
  //   because there is (usually) a significant horizontal component also
  for all CNP
    STATE that you would examine other CN
  partial CN3P
    can present with any strabismus except an ET
      small vertical
      oblique dysfunction
      INO appearance
      ± ptosis
      ± mydriasis
  patients with CN3P need imaging
    MRI + MRA ± gad OR
    noncon CT + contrast CTA
      many institutions do CTA first
        it's fast and available
        noncon CT is great for SAH
        CTA is great for PCA OR basilar aneurysms
        MR is better for tissue pathology
        MR allows you to follow the course of CN3 for other causes
    if the results are uncertain OR suggest PCA aneurysm
      catheter angiography
        often done at the time of planned embolization for PCA aneurysm
        not risk-free
          can have CVA during balloon occlusion
          morbidity 1/100
          mortality 1/1000
    exception
      complete CN3P
      totally normal pupil
      patient fits ischemic CN3P demographics
      patient has vascular risk factors
      recovery in 3 months
      no signs of aberrant regeneration // see below
    do not rely on pain
      ischemic and aneurysmal palsies can both hurt
    check the pupil again in 1 week
      to ensure the CN3P is not progressive
  ALWAYS: screen for GCA if they are old
  look for aberrant regeneration
    COMMON: lid elevation in downgaze
    ALSO:
      paradoxical eye movement
      pupil constriction with eye movement
    ALWAYS: scan a patient with aberrant regeneration
      clear indicator that the CN3P is not ischemic
    fairly common in congenital CN3P
  recurrent CN3P
    ophthalmoplegic migraine
    DM
    compression
      ethmoidal mucocele
      pituitary adenoma
      IIH
  children
    high amblyopia risk
      top concern after getting the scan is amblyopia
    surgery
      goal is 1˚ position alignment and no amblyopia
      options
        max LR recession
        detaching LR and fixating to the orbital wall
        large MR resection
        SR + IR traction sutures
          temporary
          pass through lid
          to generate medial scarring
        SO transposition to MR insertion
        ptosis
          usually poor levator function
          silicone frontalis sling
          high risk of postop exposure
            poor Bell phenomenon
            limited upgaze
  adults
    if aneurysm present on MRI + MRA
      need clipping or embolization ASAP

  7 syndromes of CN3P
    nuclear CN3P
      RARE
      CN3 nucleus innervates contralateral SR
      unpaired central caudal nucleus innervates both levators
        true nuclear CN3P has
          bilateral ptosis
          contralateral eye upgaze paralysis
    CN3 fascicle
      COMMON: ischemic
      many combinations but most are some mix of
        cerebellar peduncle
          Nothnagel syndrome
            CN3P + cerebellar ataxia
        red nucleus
          Benedikt syndrome
            CN3P + contralateral extrapyramidal tremor
        cerebral peduncle
          Weber syndrome
            CN3P + contralateral hemiparesis
    uncal herniation
      stretches CN3 across the tentorium below the temporal lobe
      often starts as a dilated and fixed pupil
      later progresses to a more complete CN3P
    PCA aneurysm
      COMMON: and important cause of CN3P with a fixed and dilated pupil
      junction of the PCA and ICA
      CN3 passes lateral to this before entering the cavernous sinus
    cavernous sinus CN3P
      CN[345(1|2)6PS]P // see 6 syndromes of CN6P in ET.txt
      COMMON: CN3 aberrant regeneration after cavernous sinus CN3P
        // see aberrant-regeneration.txt
    orbital CN3P
      CN3 splits as it enters the SOF
        CN3P may apply to only one division
          superior division
            levator
            SR
          inferior division
            MR
            IR
            IO
            parasympathetic fibers
              EW via cavernous sinus => ciliary ganglion => short ciliary Ns
                pupillary constrictors
                fibers to CB for accomodation
    pupil-sparing isolated CN3P
      usually ischemic // see notes above

DVD // covered under infantile ET

CCDD
  congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders
    CFEOM
      muscles and orbit are abnormally restricted/fibrous
      neuro abnormalities at the level of the CN nuclei
    sporadic Mobius syndrome
    // listed here because it's CCDD not because it's vertical
      CN(6+7)P
        may have CN5(1)P also
          can develop neurotrophic corneal ulcers
      mask-like facies
      limb hypoplasia
      orofacial defects
      1˚ gaze is variable
        ET
        XT
        ortho
  technically also includes
    Duane syndrome
    possibly
      CN4P
      Brown syndrome
  treatment for CFEOM OR Mobius syndrome
    MRI
      cerebrovascular abnormalities
      absent CN nuclei
    genetic counseling
    additional treatment similar to other forms of strabismus
      refract
      treat amblyopia
      address AHP

Brown syndrome
  a disorder of the young
    RARE to see adults who still have it
  look for
    chin-up AHP
      may have a head tilt to the affected side
    limitation of elevation in adduction
      congenital cases have a short SO tendon sheath
    V pattern
    positive forced ductions
      technically mandatory to diagnose Brown syndrome
    usually worse at distance
  acquired Brown syndrome
    can occur at any age
      surgery around the eye
      sinus surgery
      trauma
      inflammation
        RA
  treatment options
    range-of-motion orthoptic exercises
    peritrochlear steroid injection
    SO tenotomy OR silicone spacer (5-7 mm)
      you can leave the posterior capsule intact
        to avoid an induced CN4P
      spacer may have lower incidence of postop IOOA
        you can recess the IO to reduce postop IOOA but this isn't common
      surgical indications
        manifest HT in 1˚
        AHP
        cosmesis
      don't do surgery if you don't have to
        more than 40% get a relative SO palsy
          a portion of those may lose binocularity

MED
  HoT in both abduction and adduction
  usually also
    chin up AHP
    ptosis
  NEVER:
    diagnose MED without ruling out
      CN3P
      CCDD
  MED is really a collection of disorders
    some restrictive
    some supranuclear

orbital fracture // see also fractures-orbital.txt
  COMMON:
    adults
    floor fractures
  RARELY:
    medial wall fractures
  history
    mechanism
    vertical diplopia
      usually in floor fractures
      upgaze is limited by entrapment
        affected eye hypotropic in 1˚
      downgaze is limited by weakening of the entrapped muscle
        leads to the so-called "double diplopia"
    infraorbital anesthesia
  exam
    oculocardiac reflex
      bradycardia

    infraorbital nerve hypoesthesia
  non-contrast CT
    fractures
    orbital apex syndrome
    orbital emphysema
  treatment
    prism
      if restrictive
        put all the prism on the affected eye
        AOT comitant strabismus
          you would normally split the prism

        Faden of fellow eye IR
          uses of the Faden
            COMMON:
              DVD // see ET.txt
                SR recession boosted by Faden
              muscle paresis
                to weaken the fellow eye synergist
                COMMON: fellow MR in CN6P
              convergence excess in accomodative ET with high AC/A
                Faden added to bimedial recessions will boost effect
              floor fractures
                limitation of downgaze on the side of fracture causes diplopia
                Faden to fellow IR
          use nonabsorbable 6-0 Mersilene braided polyester
          Faden issues
            hard to get posterior
              usually well past equator
            thin sclera
              high risk of perforation
            risk of vortex vein trauma
