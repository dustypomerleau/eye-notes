ET DDx

  infantile ET
    risk factors
      FH strabismus
      maternal smoking
      premature birth
      low birth weight
      developmental delay
    VA measurement
      infants
        CSM
        objection to occlusion
        Teller PL cards
    amblyopia
      RARE: preoperatively
        check for alternating fixation
      COMMON: postoperatively
    latent nystagmus
      horizontal jerks
      away from the occluded eye
    large angle
      usually 30+ ∆
    DVD
    IOOA
    refractive error
      usually mild
      big refractive error
        broaden DDx
        correct refraction before surgery
          may have an accomodative component
    surgery
      stable angle for 2 months
      4+ months of age
      younger is better
        improves binocularity
        outcomes worse beyond age 2
        downside
          early surgery triples amblyopia risk
      under 50 ∆
        BL MR recessions
      secondary surgeries are COMMON
        consecutive XT
          high amblyopia risk
          operate quickly
        IOOA
          IO myotomy
          IO recession
          IO anterior transposition
            also helps DVD
        DVD
          usually observe
          if spontaneous and frequent
            SR recession
              ± Faden posterior fixation suture OR
                IR resection
          if concurrent IOOA
            IO anterior transposition
      goals
        motor fusion
        cosmesis
        monofixation with good alignment is OK
        true stereopsis is variable
      PEDIG RE: surgical timing
        long wait for stable angle did not improve final alignment
        early surgery improved binocularity
        early surgery should be favored
          assuming good amblyopia monitoring

  accomodative ET
    usually older
      0.5-7 years
    classic presentation
      1-2 year-old
      high hyperopia ~ 4 D
      starts intermittently
      progresses to constant ET
    risk factors
      FH strabismus
    calculate AC/A
      gradient
        test at 1/3 m
        ∆ deviation as accomodation increased with lenses
      heterophoria
        ∆ deviation going from 6 m to 1/3 m
      high AC/A
        more than 10 ∆ greater at near
        if you must do the math:
          AC/A = IPD (cm) + (∆n - ∆d)/D
            D usually = 3 going from 6 m to 1/3 m
    treatment
      pure refractive accomodative ET
        give full cycloplegic Rx
          try to give it all
          1 D less may be necessary to foster tolerance
        if they don't correct fully
          repeat the cycloplegic refraction
          adjust the glasses
        glasses must be worn full-time
        ET may get worse at first
          counsel parents
      high AC/A accomodative ET
        bifocals
          flat-top
          bisect the pupil
          up to +3 D add if needed
        goal
          fusion at all distances
          angle 10- ∆ at near
        update glasses periodically
          hyperopia increases for 5-7 years
      miotics
        poorly tolerated
        rarely used
      surgery
        always repeat the cyclorefraction first
        appropriate only in patients with partially accomodative ET
          i.e. residual ET at distance when fully corrected
        if they do need surgery
          don't delay it
          allow 1-2 weeks for glasses to work
          if no better => OT
          operate on largest near angle with full correction
          BL MR recessions
          overshoot 10 ∆
            increases risk of consecutive XT
            also increases their chances of binocularity
          monofixation outcome is common and OK
          stereopsis will be impaired even if they are straight
      red flags
        ET looks accomodative but
          sudden onset
          child over 7
          no hyperopia
          CN palsies
          papilledema
          ALWAYS: MRI

  acquired ET
    usually older than 6 m
    no accomodative component
      distance and near deviations are the same
    low threshold for MRI

      no media opacity to explain the ET
      rule out
        pontine tumors
        intracranial bleed
    types
      basic acquired ET
      sensory acquired ET
        cataract
        media opacity
      divergence insufficiency
        worse at distance
    treatment
      rule out neurologic causes as above
      address amblyopia
        especially in sensory acquired ET
      prism adaptation first
      then surgery

                  CN3P is usually incomplete
                  CN4 is almost never involved in isolation
                  CN6 is involved in isolation with CC aneurysms
                    but usually with tumors CN6 would not be involved alone
                  the pupil is not reliable in cavernous sinus lesions
                    both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers run in the CS
                    the pupil can favor the CN3P aspect or the Horner aspect

              if there is evidence of one of the first 5 syndromes of CN6P
                scan today
                isolated CN6P is really the same as the face turn example above
              if there is no evidence of the first 5 syndromes of CN6P
                i.e. 6th syndrome AKA isolated CN6P
                scan within 1-2 months
                  in an adult with ischemic demographics
                    you can wait a bit longer
                    still expect improvement of ischemic CN6P in 12 weeks

  convergence spasm AKA spasm of the near reflex
    usually functional
    RARELY:
      brainstem pathology
      demyelinating disease
    MRI brain and orbits
      rule out above
      rule out CN6P
    pseudomyopia that resolves with cyclorefraction
    ask about social factors

      placebo drops

  age-related distance ET AKA sagging eye syndrome
    // not to be confused with heavy eye syndrome in high myopes
    // elderly myopes can be affected by either syndrome
    elderly patients
    small ET
      due to LR-SR muscle band involution
    worse at distance
