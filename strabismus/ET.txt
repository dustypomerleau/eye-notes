        amblyopia
            RARE: preoperatively
                check for alternating fixation
            COMMON: postoperatively
        latent nystagmus
            horizontal jerks

            4+ months of age
            younger is better
                improves binocularity
                outcomes worse beyond age 2
                downside
                    early surgery triples amblyopia risk
            under 50 ∆
                BL MR recessions
            secondary surgeries are COMMON

                monofixation with good alignment is OK
                true stereopsis is variable
            PEDIG RE: surgical timing
                long wait for stable angle did not improve final alignment
                early surgery improved binocularity
                early surgery should be favored
                    assuming good amblyopia monitoring

    accomodative ET
        usually older

            high AC/A
                more than 10 ∆ greater at near
                if you must do the math:
                    AC/A = IPD (cm) + (∆n - ∆d)/D
                        D usually = 3 going from 6 m to 1/3 m
        treatment

                give full cycloplegic Rx
                    try to give it all
                    1 D less may be necessary to foster tolerance
                if they don't correct fully
                    repeat the cycloplegic refraction
                    adjust the glasses
                glasses must be worn full-time

                    don't delay it

                    overshoot 10 ∆
                        increases risk of consecutive XT
                        also increases their chances of binocularity
                    monofixation outcome is common and OK

                                        complicated otitis media
                                            extradural abscess
                                        petrous apex syndrome can present like a CPA lesion

                                                    CN6P is RARE with CPA lesions
                                                        check motility in any CN[578]P
                                                        if CN6P is present consider petrous apex syndrome
                                cavernous sinus syndrome
                                    CN[345(1|2)6PS]P
                                        nasopharyngeal carcinoma
                                            COMMON: CN6P + 5(2) pain or sensory loss
                                        ICA aneurysm
                                        CC fistula

                                            Aspergillus
                                            Mucor
                                    CN3P is usually incomplete
                                    CN4 is almost never involved in isolation
                                    CN6 is involved in isolation with CC aneurysms
                                        but usually with tumors CN6 would not be involved alone
                                    the pupil is not reliable in cavernous sinus lesions
                                        both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers run in the CS
                                        the pupil can favor the CN3P aspect or the Horner aspect
                                        COMMON: pupil sparing
                                            apparent pupil sparing sometimes due to P + S damage
                                orbital syndrome
                                    proptosis

                                        CN3P style
                                        Horner style
                                            proptosis can mask ptosis
                                    disc swelling

                                isolated CN6P
                                    covered above
                            if there is evidence of one of the first 5 syndromes of CN6P
                                scan today
                                isolated CN6P is really the same as the face turn example above
                            if there is no evidence of the first 5 syndromes of CN6P
                                i.e. 6th syndrome AKA isolated CN6P
                                scan within 1–2 months
                                    in an adult with ischemic demographics
                                        you can wait a bit longer
                                        still expect improvement of ischemic CN6P in 12 weeks

    convergence spasm AKA spasm of the near reflex
        usually functional
        RARELY:
            brainstem pathology
            demyelinating disease
        MRI brain and orbits
            rule out above
            rule out CN6P
        pseudomyopia that resolves with cyclorefraction
        ask about social factors
            kid needs attention
            secondary gain
        treatment
            cycloplegics
            placebo drops

    age-related distance ET AKA sagging eye syndrome
        // not to be confused with heavy eye syndrome in high myopes
        // elderly myopes can be affected by either syndrome
        elderly patients
        small ET
            due to LR-SR muscle band involution
        worse at distance
        usually they already wear glasses
            will gladly accept a little prism to fix this
