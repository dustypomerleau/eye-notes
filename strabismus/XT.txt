XT DDx

  intermittent XT
    X(T) is a diagnosis
      not just a description
    classic presentation
      2-3 YO
      normal
        VA
        binocularity
        refractive error
      closes 1 eye in bright light
      develops X(T) with distance tasks or fatigue
    // do X(T) special testing and grade recovery // see strabismus.txt
    grade recovery
      Newcastle control score

              spontaneous recovery (0)
              recovers after blink OR refixation (2)
              manifests spontaneously OR no recovery (3)
        grade: best control (0) to worst control (9)
    measure angle // see types below
      distance
      far distance
      near
      near with +3
      near after 45 minutes occlusion
    types
      basic X(T)
        distance and near measurements 10- ∆ apart
      divergence excess
        XT is 10+ ∆ larger at distance
          simulated
            ± TPF
          true
            ± high AC/A
        simulated divergence excess
          patch for 45 minutes
          measure again at near without allowing fusion first
          if the measurements fit with basic X(T) after patching
            diagnosis
              simulated divergence excess X(T)
              + tenacious proximal fusion (TPF)
          if the measurements are still 10+ ∆ at distance after patching
            diagnosis
              true divergence excess X(T)
            without allowing fusion
            test at near with a +3 add
            if 20+ ∆ increase at near with the +3 add
              diagnosis
                true divergence excess X(T)
                + high AC/A
      convergence weakness
        worse at near
        not in any way related to true convergence insufficiency in adults
    red flags
      angle gets bigger
      deviation becomes constant
        size of the deviation does not matter if it's stable
          what matters is how much of the time they can control it
      child develops suppression
    treatment
      correct refractive error
        better vision will drive fusion
        leave hyperopes slightly hyperopic to drive convergence
      observe if possible
      treat if
        red flags
        angle present the majority of the time
        patient highly symptomatic
      options
        most patients decompensate and need surgery
        can try
          orthoptic exercises
            usually in conjunction with other methods
            diplopia awareness AKA anti-suppression
            convergence exercises
          spectacles
            minus lenses
            overminus most helpful in high AC/A
          BI prisms
            not effective long-term
        surgery
          // for exam purposes
            Kushner (1998)
              basic
                unilateral R & R
              divergence excess // Kushner looked at simulated but not true
                LR recessions
              convergence weakness // not specifically looked at by Kushner
                MR resections
              for exam purposes
                do *not* overcorrect
          // not for exam purposes - RF preferences
            LR recessions
              operate on the largest deviation you find
                usually distance
              dicey
                best chance of binocularity is inital 10 ∆ overcorrection
                  later becomes ortho
                but if the ET persists
                  very likely to develop amblyopia
                  watch them like a hawk
              patients with high AC/A true divergence excess
                may need bifocals postoperatively
            convergence weakness is a special surgical case
              may do better with MR resections

  congenital XT
    congenital XT is RARE
    ALWAYS:
      MRI
      work up for
        systemic disease
        neurologic disorders
        developmental delay
    binocularity is a low priority in congenital XT
      prevent amblyopia
      achieve cosmetic alignment

  consecutive XT
    most common adult strabismus by a huge margin
    bimodal
      early postoperative presentation in kids
      late adult presentation
    risk factors
      poor binocularity
      multiple surgeries
    exam
      DVD
        very common
        helps confirm former infantile ET
      A pattern
      previous surgical scars
        often patients do not know their history
      if abnormal ductions
        forced ductions
          many patients will have restriction
            tight LR
            slipped or weak MR
      cycloplegic refraction
        regardless of age
        measure the angle again after cyclo
          eliminates accomodative convergence
    ask about diplopia
      if no diplopia
        postop diplopia test
          fresnel prisms
          BOTOX
            predictive and therapeutic
          // see OSCE notes for details
    surgery
      do less surgery on previously operated muscles
        effect is magnified
      if you recess the LR
        use an adjustable suture

  decompensating (X)
    patients are fully binocular
    when the deviation is manifest
      diplopia
      eye strain
    symptoms
      similar to CN4P
      exam shows intermittent horizontal strabismus
    treatment
      often need surgery
        usually the angle is too big for prism
        when the angle is small
          fresnels degrade vision
            patients lose binocularity
      totally different surgery and disease than kids with X(T)
        aim for undercorrection
          helps avoid diplopia
          adult patients will pull the eye in the last few ∆

  sensory XT
    classic case
      longstanding traumatic cataract
      XT present many years
      patient can not fuse when vision is restored
        intractable diplopia after cataract surgery
      if vision is adequate
        test for fusion before offering surgery
           synoptophore better than prisms in this group
    strabismus surgery
      define your goals
        if patient unable to fuse
          observe
          operate for purely cosmetic reasons
