albinism

    ask about
        bleeding
        bruising
        recurrent infections
        developmental milestones

    all albinism
        decreased VA
            COMMON: foveal hypoplasia
            ALSO: ON hypoplasia
        nystagmus
            COMMON: PAN
        reduced stereopsis
            over-decussation at the chiasm
            confirmed by asymmetric VEP
        iris TID
        fundus hypopigmentation
        foveal hypoplasia
            Â± ON hypoplasia

    AR OCA // mnemonic: 'he's A ROCkAh'
        7 types primarily based on mutation
        spectrum of tyrosinase activity
        the term 'tyrosinase negative' has been abandoned in favor of a continuum
            generally
                more tyrosinase activity (previously tyrosinase positive)
                    better VA
                        6/36+ requires some tyrosinase activity

    XLR OA
        XLR therefore predominantly boys
        OA1 is the usual variant
            mud splattered fundus in carrier females
        OA2 overlaps clinically with some forms of CSNB


    syndromes

        Hermansky-Pudlak
            AR OCA
            bleeding problems from low platelets
            lung disease
            colitis
            Swiss or Puerto Ricans
                H[PPP] [Pudlak, Platelets, Puerto Ricans]

        Chediak-Higashi
            AR OCA
            severe pyogenic infections
            mucosal inflammation and ulceration
            coagulation problems
            neurologic decline
            early death
            blood smear to diagnose
            most common of the silvery hair syndromes with Griscelli and Elejalde

        albinoidism
            hypopigmentation
            normal vision
            normal fovea

        AD Waardenburg syndrome
            patchy piebald skin and hair
            heterochromic irides
            sometimes deafness


    management
        examine parents and siblings
        skin biopsy
            to prove carrier state
                macromelanosomes are present in carriers
            to determine if there is any tyrosinase activity
                presence of microscopic melanin is helpful
                melanocytes can be cultured and tested for tyrosinase expression
        systemic workup for HP & CH
        aggressive sun protection
            sunglasses
            sunscreen
            hats and full clothing
            will need to work indoors as an adult
        address
            refractive error
            strabismus
            amblyopia
        ALWAYS: refer to a geneticist
        ALWAYS: refer for low vision rehabilitation
            // Royal Society for the Blind in AU
            low vision clinic referral
            optimize the home environment for low vision safety
            low vision schooling
                usually for those with complete absence of tyrosinase activity
