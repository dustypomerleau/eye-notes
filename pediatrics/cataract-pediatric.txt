        low birth weight is a risk factor

      Down syndrome 5%
      Rubella 3%
      aniridia 1%
      JIA 1%
      DM 1%
      galactosemia 1%
      other metabolic syndromes (collectively) 4%

Mackey approach to congenital cataracts
  Does the child have a known syndrome or systemic illness?
    Are they dysmorphic or unwell?
  Does the anterior segment give you the diagnosis?
    anterior segment dysgenesis
  check that the posterior segment is normal
    if no view
      BSUS
        Rb
        RD
  examine parents and siblings for signs of hereditary cataract
  investigations
    Rubella serology
      the most important of the TORCHES WRT cataract
      mother is usually from a country without routine immunization
    urine reducing substances
      galactosemia
    urine amino acids
      Lowe syndrome
    urine RBCs
      Lowe syndrome
      Alport syndrome
    serum ferritin
      hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome

evaluation

  FH
    all genetic diseases
  birth history
  developmental milestones
  consult pediatrician
    physical exam
    systemic diseases
    genetics
    syndromes
    rule out child abuse
  examine parents and siblings

  assume diameter 3+ mm is visually significant
    anterior polar less visually concerning
      ALWAYS: check and manage refractive error
    lamellar AKA zonular cataract
      may be AD and bilateral
      can be amblyogenic or progressive
    congenital nuclear cataract
      may be AD
      highly amblyogenic

  measure VA
    interest, bright objects
    CSM, 20 ∆ BD, base-to-base ∆ test: do they alternate?
    PL/grating
    Kay/Allen/Lea
    HOTV/SG
    Snellen/ETDRS
    if they are old enough
      test with glare

  ALWAYS: refract

  eye exam
    including DFE

  labs // not needed with a clear FH or syndrome
    TORCH titers
    genetic testing for any suspected syndrome
    endocrine testing for any suspected syndrome
    baseline tests in a mystery case
      DM
        fasting glucose
      renal syndromes
        UEC
        urine amino acids
      galactosemia
        blood GCT
          galactosemia reflex test
          gives GALT/Hb
        serum galactose
        urine reducing substances
        RBC Gal-1-P levels
        serum galactokinase
      hypoparathyroidism
        low calcium
        elevated phosphorous
      hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome
        serum ferritin

treatment

  give best refraction

  remove the cataract if it is visually significant
    unilateral or asymmetric
      remove before 6 weeks of age
    bilateral and symmetric
      remove before 10 weeks of age
    consider a modified capsulorrhexis
      2-incision push-pull technique
        helps control the highly elastic capsule
    primary posterior capsulotomy
    primary anterior vitrectomy
    older than 1 year
      implant an acrylic IOL
      aim +1–2 D
      make sure eyes are matched with postop MRx
    younger than 1 year
      sequential surgery
      aphakic spectacles at first
      subsequent IOL implantation
        after 1 year of age

  treat any amblyopia
    starting immediately after surgery
