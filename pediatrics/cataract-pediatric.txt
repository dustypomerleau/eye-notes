Mackey approach to congenital cataracts
    Does the child have a known syndrome or systemic illness?
        Are they dysmorphic or unwell?
    Does the anterior segment give you the diagnosis?
        anterior segment dysgenesis
    check that the posterior segment is normal
        if no view
            BSUS
                Rb
                RD
    examine parents and siblings for signs of hereditary cataract
    investigations
        Rubella serology
            the most important of the TORCHES WRT cataract

evaluation

    FH
        all genetic diseases
    birth history
    developmental milestones
    consult pediatrician
        physical exam
        systemic diseases
        genetics
        syndromes
        rule out child abuse
    examine parents and siblings

    assume diameter 3+ mm is visually significant
        anterior polar less visually concerning
            ALWAYS: check and manage refractive error
        lamellar AKA zonular cataract
            may be AD and bilateral
            can be amblyogenic or progressive
        congenital nuclear cataract
            may be AD
            highly amblyogenic

    measure VA
        interest, bright objects
        CSM, 20 ∆ BD, base-to-base ∆ test: do they alternate?
        PL/grating
        Kay/Allen/Lea
        HOTV/SG
        Snellen/ETDRS
        if they are old enough
            test with glare

    ALWAYS: refract

    eye exam
        including DFE

    labs // not needed with a clear FH or syndrome
        TORCH titers
        genetic testing for any suspected syndrome

treatment

    give best refraction

    remove the cataract if it is visually significant
        unilateral or asymmetric
            remove before 6 weeks of age
        bilateral and symmetric
            remove before 10 weeks of age
        consider a modified capsulorrhexis
            2-incision push-pull technique
                helps control the highly elastic capsule
        primary posterior capsulotomy
        primary anterior vitrectomy
        older than 1 year
            implant an acrylic IOL
            aim +1–2 D
            make sure eyes are matched with postop MRx
        younger than 1 year
            sequential surgery
            aphakic spectacles at first
            subsequent IOL implantation
                after 1 year of age

    treat any amblyopia
        starting immediately after surgery
