  Rb treatment
    ALWAYS: oncology referral
    small tumors (A) // in AU they might do SALT on a B
      systemic chemotherapy
      TTT
      PBT
      laser
      cryo
    large unilateral tumors
      usually enucleation
        enucleation
          try for 15+ mm of optic nerve
            in case there is infiltration
          if there is extension beyond the globe
            +
              high-dose chemo
              EBRT
    large bilateral tumors
      systemic chemoreduction
        vincristine
        etoposide
        carboplatin
      if they fail chemoreduction
        EBRT
        subTenon chemo
          carboplatin
      sequential aggressive local therapy (SALT)
        chemoreduction followed by
          laser
          cryo
          PBT
      intraarterial chemo
        melphalan
        effective but high-risk
      intravitreal chemotherapy
        melphalan
        for vitreous seeding
    poor prognosis for metastatic disease
      fortunately this is rare at presentation

  Rb genetics
    13q14 RB1 gene

    no FH
      unilateral Rb
        15% germline
          multiple *distinct* tumors in 1 eye strongly suggest germline
      bilateral Rb
        98% germline
          assumed to be 100% for counseling purposes
        1/3 of sporadic Rb are bilateral
          presumed sporadic germline mutations

    if you don't know it's germline
      unilateral Rb in a patient with unaffected parents
        15% likelihood it is germline *
        50% likelihood of passing it on *
        90% penetrance =
          7% likelihood of an affected child
            85% of those affected will be bilateral
      what about the patient's future siblings?
        risk is higher than pure chance
          increased from << 1% to ~1%
        why?
          parent could be a carrier but unaffected
            remember that penetrance of germline mutations is only 90%
          doesn't make much difference to counseling

    if you know it is germline
      parent has Rb OR
      patient has bilateral Rb
        50% transmission * 90% penetrance =
          45% chance each child will be affected
            85% of those affected will be bilateral
      future siblings of bilateral patient with unaffected parents?
        higher likelihood that the parent is an unaffected carrier // see above
        risk to future siblings is ~5%

    genetic testing can help determine if the mutation is germline
      methods
        PCR
        karyotyping
        FISH
        MLPA
        RNA analysis
      most new mutations will be picked up
        about 1/20 will be missed
          positives are helpful
          negatives should be viewed with caution

Coats disease
  unilateral
  usually males
  classification // not particularly important
    telangiectasias (1)
    exudation (2)
      2B involves the fovea
    RD (3)

    cryo
    RARELY: surgery

  hearing loss
