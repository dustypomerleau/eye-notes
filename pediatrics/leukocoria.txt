  Rb treatment
    ALWAYS: oncology referral
    small tumors (A) // in AU they might do SALT on a B
      systemic chemotherapy
      TTT
      PBT
      laser
      cryo
    large unilateral tumors
      usually enucleation
        enucleation
          try for 15+ mm of optic nerve
            in case there is infiltration
          if there is extension beyond the globe
            +
              high-dose chemo
              EBRT
    large bilateral tumors
      systemic chemoreduction
        vincristine
        etoposide
        carboplatin

          cryo
          PBT

        melphalan
        effective but high-risk
      intravitreal chemotherapy
        melphalan

    poor prognosis for metastatic disease
      fortunately this is rare at presentation

  Rb genetics
    13q14 RB1 gene

    no FH
      unilateral Rb
        15% germline
          multiple *distinct* tumors in 1 eye strongly suggest germline
      bilateral Rb
        98% germline
          assumed to be 100% for counseling purposes
        1/3 of sporadic Rb are bilateral
          presumed sporadic germline mutations

    if you don't know it's germline
      unilateral Rb in a patient with unaffected parents
        15% likelihood it is germline *
        50% likelihood of passing it on *
        90% penetrance =
          7% likelihood of an affected child
            85% of those affected will be bilateral
      what about the patient's future siblings?
        risk is higher than pure chance
          increased from << 1% to ~1%
        why?
          parent could be a carrier but unaffected
            remember that penetrance of germline mutations is only 90%
          doesn't make much difference to counseling

    if you know it is germline
      parent has Rb OR
      patient has bilateral Rb
        50% transmission * 90% penetrance =
          45% chance each child will be affected
            85% of those affected will be bilateral
      future siblings of bilateral patient with unaffected parents?
        higher risk that parent is an unaffected carrier // see above
        risk to future siblings is ~5%

    genetic testing can help determine if the mutation is germline
      methods
        PCR
        karyotyping
        FISH
        MLPA
        RNA analysis
      most new mutations will be picked up
        about 1/20 will be missed
          so positives are helpful
          negatives should be viewed with caution
