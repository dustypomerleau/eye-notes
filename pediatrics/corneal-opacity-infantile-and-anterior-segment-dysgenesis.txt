anterior segment dysgenesis

  sporadic Peters anomaly
    also reported with
      Axenfeld-Rieger
      congenital rubella
    corneal opacity
    posterior corneal defect
    iridocorneal OR lenticulocorneal adhesions
    if Peters anomaly is bilateral
      work up for
        brain defects
        heart defects
        genetic syndromes

  AD Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome
    posterior embryotoxon AKA Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly
      anterior displacement of the Schwalbe line
      present in
        isolated posterior embryotoxon
        Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome
        Alagille syndrome
          facial abnormalities
          posterior embryotoxon
          ON drusen
          heart and lung malformations
          vertebral defects
          shortage of bile ducts
    iris adhesions
    iris stromal hypoplasia
    eccentric pupils AKA corectopia
    iris holes AKA pseudopolycoria
    systemic findings
      small teeth AKA microdontia
      broad nasal bridge
      telecanthus
      redundant periumbilical skin
      hypospadias
    glaucoma is a major concern

  aniridia ± WAGR
    PAX6 mutations
      2/3 AD
      1/3 sporadic
      PAX6 mutations predispose to Wilms tumor even without full WAGR
        Wilms tumor is most often seen in sporadic aniridia
        1/3 of sporadic aniridia develops Wilms tumor
      RARELY: Gillespie syndrome
        AR aniridia
        cerebellar ataxia
        mental retardation
    ptosis
      1/10
      usually bilateral and symmetric
    aniridia-associated keratopathy (AAK)
      1/5
      very thick pachymetry
        ALWAYS: check CCT before interpreting IOPs
        can be 100 µm thicker than normal
      LSCD with late corneal scarring
        may have adequate stem cells until there is an insult
          CEIOL with manipulation of limbal tissues
          trabeculectomy with MMC applied near the limbus
      poorly differentiated epithelium
    COMMON: iris hypoplasia
      often complete absence
    COMMON: glaucoma 2˚ abnormal angle tissue
    lens abnormalities
      COMMON: cataract
        1/2 of cases
        ALWAYS: consider amblyopia prevention
          in practice
            usually not dense enough to require pediatric CEIOL
      ALSO:
        zonular weakness
        subluxation
        lens coloboma
        posterior lenticonus
        microspherophakia
    CB hypoplasia
      less than the iris
    ON hypoplasia
      1/10
      RARELY: ON coloboma
    COMMON: foveal hypoplasia
      nystagmus
      retinal vessels may cross the FAZ
    investigations
      GP involvement to assess for WAGR
        sporadic has the greatest risk of WAGR
        AD can have WAGR if other family members have WAGR
      ALWAYS: renal US q 3 months until age 8
        most Wilms tumor occurs before age 5
      genetic testing for PAX6 OR WT1 mutations
        genetic counseling if appropriate
      urinalysis for protein
    AAK
      PF lubricants
      autologous serum drops
      LSC allograft
        they don't usually have enough LSC for an autograft
      lamellar limbokeratoplasty
    aniridic glaucoma
      does not respond well to angle surgery like PCG
        exception
          prophylactic goniotomy before the IOP rises
          useful in patients with early membranes noted in the angle
      trabeculectomy is usually necessary
      OK to try topicals but success with meds is low
      diode TSCPC is sometimes necessary
        high risk of phthisis and RD in aniridic patients
        don't use it first line
    CEIOL is rarely needed in kids
      but if you do perform CEIOL
        black diaphragm aniridic IOL

  specific genes
    homeobox
      PAX6
        Peters anomaly
        aniridia ± WAGR
      PITX2
        Peters anomaly
        Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome
      FOXC1
        Peters anomaly
        Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome
    cytochrome
      CYP1B1
        Peters anomaly
        PCG
          ALSO: MYOC
            MYOC mutations are more common in JOAG and adult POAG than PCG
