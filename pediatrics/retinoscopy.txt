/*
The term 'axis' is fraught with ambiguity. You need to discipline yourself not to use it loosely (even though everyone around you is doing it).

The cornea has meridians. It could be said that the eye as a whole has meridians.

Astigmatic prescriptions have an axis.

The power of cylindrical lenses is applied to the meridian 90° away from the prescribed axis.

When discussing corneal topography, you should discuss the meridian affected by steepening/flattening.

When discussing toric IOLs, for example, you mark the meridian on the cornea that aligns with the axis of the IOL you're implanting. The power of the IOL is actually applied to the meridian 90° away from the one you've marked.

retinoscopy technique
  add minus until you have 'with' in all directions
  line up your streak with the reflex to get the axis
  add plus to neutralize the meridian perpendicular to that axis
    or the one 90° away
    whichever neutralizes first
  draw your power cross
    label the ° of both meridians
    label the power of the meridian you just neutralized
  neutralize 90° away
    label the power of that meridian
      in absolute terms
  write out the Rx
    write the lower plus power
    use the difference between the two absolute powers for the cylinder
    picture the streak orientation for the higher powered meridian
      that's your axis
      90° away from the meridian
  -1.5 D working distance from the sphere for final Rx
