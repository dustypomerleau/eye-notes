                erythema
                ulceration
            marginal infiltrates
                where the lids cross the limbus in primary gaze
                    10 & 2
                    4 & 8
                hypersensitivity response to Staph. toxins
                    probably immune-complex deposition
            phlyctenules
                cell-mediated immune response to Staph. toxins
                vascularization
                limbal nodules
            both SA and SE can cause it
        seborrheic blepharitis
            flaking
            look for other dermatitis

                scalp
        Demodex
            sleeves are pathognomonic
            present in normals and blepharitis
            not clear if it causes any symptoms
            some people treat for it
    posterior
        MGD
            prominent vessels
                cross the mucocutaneous junction
            foamy discharge
            thick or turbid secretions
            increased evaporation
                rapid TBUT
                poor tear meniscus
                    also present with ATD
            hyperosmolarity
            rosacea
                facial telangiectasias
                midfacial erythema
                papules
                rhinophyma

chronic blepharitis masquerades
    sebaceous cell carcinoma
    discoid lupus
    IBD
        ulcerative blepharitis

treatment
    eyelid cleansing
        good for both anterior and posterior blepharitis
        baby shampoo
            dilute
        finger or cotton swab
    warm compresses
        best for MGD
        hotter is better
        don't burn the skin
        twice a day
    Chlorsig at bedtime for a few weeks
    doxycycline 50 mg bd x 2â€“6 weeks
        best for rosacea MGD
        has antibiotic and antiinflammatory properties
        reduces SE & SA lipase production
    mild topical steroids
        FML
        loteprednol
        particularly for
            marginal keratitis
            phlyctenules
        use acutely but not chronically
            taper after a couple weeks
    cyclosporine
        refractory MGD
