primary graft failure
  graft never clears after surgery
graft rejection
  graft was clear after surgery for at least 2/52
  epithelial rejection
    usually about 3/12 out
    superficial Kaye dot infiltrates
  stromal rejection
    anytime in the first 2 years
    full thickness oedema
    confined to the limits of the graft
  endothelial rejection
    usually within the first year
    most aggressive
    KP
    diffuse graft oedema
    Khodadoust line
      near the vascularised edge of the graft
    AC cell
    5+ KP + Khodadoust = severe rejection
    for endothelial rejection
      some use systemic steroids in addition to topicals
        IVMP OR po prednisolone
          no evidence this really helps
          probably not justified
  cell-mediated process
  about 1/10 grafts will reject
  secondary graft failure
    cornea fails after rejection
    when to declare failure
      rejection persists 3/12
      vision is compromised by oedema
    HSV recurrence in a corneal graft
      delay topical steroids until (nearly) epithelialised
      if HSV recurs in a graft while on aciclovir
        aciclovir resistance testing

late graft failure (AOT graft rejection)
  slow onset of oedema
  no AC WBC
  no KP
  no Khodadoust rejection line

likely graft rejection
  young
  autoimmune disease
  atopy
  ocular surface disease
  original condition that can recur
    HSV
    VZV
    corneal dystrophy
  multiple prior grafts
  big graft
    large donor button size
  eccentric graft
  NVK
    2+ quads = high risk
  loose sutures
  graft infection
  intraoperative trauma to endothelium
    especially in combined cases
  uveitis
  glaucoma
  ACIOL
  low ECT in donor
  high antigen load in donor
  poor donor match
  treatment
    ADMIT
    remove vascularised sutures
    culture any suspicious infiltrate
    hourly PF
    IV or oral steroids
      no evidence for IVMP over po prednisolone
      //... revisit this Elsie says no evidence for systemic
    Chlorsig prophylaxis

specular microscopy report
  cell density (cells/mm2) (CD)
    normal endothelial cell counts
      5000 @ birth
      3000 @ 40
      2000 @ 70
      3000+ is acceptable for PK OR DSEK
  number of cells analysed (NUM)
  average cell area (µm2) (AVE)
  standard deviation of the average cell area (SD)
  maximum and minimum cell areas (MAX, MIN)
  coefficient of variation (CV)
    measures polymegathism
    i.e. How variable are the cell areas?
    0.4+ is abnormal
  percentage of 6-sided cells (6P)
    measures pleomorphism
    50-% is abnormal
  abnormal specular microscopy
    FED
      to delay DMEK in FED OR PBK
        hairdryer
        hypertonic saline
    PBK
      Chlorsig prophylaxis if ruptured bullae
    ICE
    CTL
    anterior uveitis
    glaucoma
    medications
      CAI

when combining or staging DSEK + CEIOL
  DSEK may induce hyperopia
  aim more myopic than usual
    ~ -2
  DMEK would significantly reduce this concern
    still mostly DSEK in AU
    so mention hyperopic shift
  DSEK + CEIOL
    higher failure rate of DSEK
    perform CEIOL first unless
      frank bullae
      decompensated cornea with no view

endothelial keratoplasty
  indications
    FED
    PBK
    PK graft failure
    ICE syndrome

pain after DSEK OR DMEK
  high pressure
    pupillary block from the bubble
      mitigating options
        preop yag
        postop dilating drops
        SPI
          not popular
          can bleed
      treat
        medically
        in an emergency
          burp air out the wound
  epi defect
