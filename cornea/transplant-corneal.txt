primary graft failure
    graft never clears after surgery

graft rejection
    graft was clear after surgery for at least 2 weeks
    epithelial rejection
        usually about 3 months out
        superficial Kaye dot infiltrates
    stromal rejection
        anytime in the first 2 years
        full thickness edema
        confined to the limits of the graft
    endothelial rejection
        usually within the first year
        most aggressive
        KP
        diffuse graft edema
        Khodadoust line
            near the vascularized edge of the graft
        AC cell
        5+ KP + Khodadoust = severe rejection
        for endothelial rejection
            some use systemic steroids in addition to topicals
                IVMP OR po prednisolone
                    no evidence this really helps
                    probably not justified
    cell-mediated process
    about 1/10 grafts will reject
    secondary graft failure
        cornea fails after rejection
        when to declare failure
            rejection persists 3 months
            vision is compromised by edema
        HSV recurrence in a corneal graft
            delay topical steroids until (nearly) epithelialized
            if HSV recurs in a graft while on aciclovir
                aciclovir resistance testing

late graft failure (AOT graft rejection)
    slow onset of edema
    no AC WBC
    no KP
    no Khodadoust rejection line

likely graft rejection
    young
    autoimmune disease
    atopy
    ocular surface disease
    original condition that can recur
        HSV
        VZV
        corneal dystrophy
    multiple prior grafts
    big graft
        large donor button size
    eccentric graft
    NVK
        2+ quads = high risk
    loose sutures
    graft infection
    intraoperative trauma to endothelium
        especially in combined cases
    uveitis
    glaucoma
    ACIOL
    low CD in donor
    high antigen load in donor
    poor donor match
    treatment
        ADMIT
        remove vascularized sutures
        culture any suspicious infiltrate
        hourly PF
        IV OR oral steroids
            optional
                no real evidence systemic steroids help
                no evidence for IVMP over po prednisolone
        Chlorsig prophylaxis

specular microscopy report
    cell density (cells/mm2) (CD)
        normal endothelial cell counts
            5000 @ birth
            3000 @ 40
            2000 @ 70
            3000+ is acceptable for PK or DSEK
    number of cells analyzed (NUM)
    average cell area (Âµm2) (AVE)
    standard deviation of the average cell area (SD)
    maximum and minimum cell areas (MAX, MIN)
    coefficient of variation (CV)
        measures polymegathism
        i.e. How variable are the cell areas?
        0.4+ is abnormal
    percentage of 6-sided cells (6A)
        measures pleomorphism
        50-% is abnormal
    abnormal specular microscopy
        FED
            to delay DMEK in FED or PBK
                hairdryer
                hypertonic saline
        PBK
            Chlorsig prophylaxis if ruptured bullae
        ICE syndrome
        CTL
        anterior uveitis
        glaucoma
        medications
            CAI

when combining or staging DSEK + CEIOL
    DSEK may induce hyperopia
        aim more myopic than usual
            ~ -2
        DMEK significantly reduces this concern
    DSEK + CEIOL
        higher failure rate of DSEK
        perform CEIOL first unless
            frank bullae
            decompensated cornea with no view

endothelial keratoplasty
    indications
        FED
        PBK
        PK graft failure
        ICE syndrome

pain after DSEK OR DMEK
    high pressure
        pupillary block from the bubble
            mitigating options
                preop yag
                postop dilating drops
                SPI
                    not popular
                    can bleed
            treat
                medically
                in an emergency
                    burp air out the wound
    ED

suture technique
    for
        PK
        DALK
        corneal laceration
        ...
    equal bites
    equal depth
    begin radial
    end radial
    when rotating sutures
        rotate at the time of insertion
            tract is most open
        rotate knots back to just beneath the surface
            easiest removal later
