refractive surgery options

    KRS
        LASIK - cut a flap that includes the epithelium and some stroma
        LASEK - loosen only the epithelium with alcohol and fold it back
        epi-LASIK - cut a flap that includes only epithelium
        PRK - scrape only epithelium and allow it to regrow

        general guidelines for KRS
            age 20–60
            MRx SE +4 to -9
                max cyl 4- D
            CCT
                505+ for LASIK
                475+ for PRK
            posterior float 45- µm
            steepest central K 47- D
                // coincidentally 47+ D is one of the diagnostic criteria for KCN
            healthy cornea, ocular surface, and tear film
            easygoing personality

        calculating maximum possible ablation in diopters
            plan to leave minimum 300 µm base
            LASIK flap thickness ~ 110 µm
                less in LASEK and epi-LASIK
            ablation ~ 15 µm/D
            so maximum ablation in D = (CCT - 110 - 300)/15


    phakic IOL
        candidates
            intolerant of CTL
            inadequate corneal thickness for safe laser
        MRx SE +8 to -20 D
        early models
            endothelial cell loss
            glaucoma
                pupil block
                    ALWAYS: perform LPI x 2 (usually @ 11 & 1) 1 week before surgery
                pigmentary
            cataract
        but these aspects are improving with better lens design
        may need to be repositioned or replaced for high vaulting (iris contact)

    RLE
        useful in high myopia or high hyperopia


    astigmatism
        KRS
            up to 4 D if patient meets other criteria for KRS
        toric phakic IOL
            ± bioptic KRS
        RLE with toric IOL
            ± bioptic KRS
        RARELY: LRI
