refractive surgery options

  KRS
    LASIK - cut a flap that includes the epithelium and some stroma
    LASEK - loosen only the epithelium with alcohol and fold it back
    epi-LASIK - cut a flap that includes only epithelium
    PRK - scrape only epithelium and allow it to regrow

    general guidelines for KRS
      age 20-60
      MRx SE +4 to -9
        max cyl 4- D
      CCT 505 for LASIK
          475 for PRK
      posterior float under 45 µm high
      steepest central K under 47 D
        // coincidentally 47+ D is one of the diagnostic criteria for KCN
      healthy cornea, ocular surface, and tear film
      easygoing personality

    calculating maximum possible ablation in diopters
      plan to leave minimum 300 µm base
      flap thickness ~ 110 µm
        less in LASEK and epi-LASIK
      ablation ~ 15 µm/D
      so maximum ablation in D = (CCT - 110 - 300)/15


  phakic ICL
    candidates
      intolerant of CTL
      inadequate corneal thickness for safe laser
    MRx SE +8 to -20 D
    early models
      endothelial cell loss
      glaucoma
        pupil block
          ALWAYS: perform LPI x 2 (usually 1100 & 0100) 1 week before surgery
        pigmentary
      cataract
    but these aspects are improving with better lens design
    may need to be repositioned or replaced for high vaulting (iris contact)

  RLE
    useful in high myopia or high hyperopia


  astigmatism
    KRS
      up to 4 D if patient meets other criteria for KRS
    toric phakic ICL
      ± bioptic KRS
    RLE with toric IOL
      ± bioptic KRS
    RARELY: LRI

KRS complications
  flap
    buttonholing
    free cap
  ablation errors
    data input
    MRx different from wavefront
    poor laser alignment
      surgeon error
      patient movement
  postop
    flap
      dislocation
      striae
      epithelial ingrowth
        if visually significant
          lift the flap and ablate with alcohol
      DLK
        sands of the sahara
        greatest in periphery
        quiet AC
        COMMON: POD 1 onset
        aggressive topical steroids
          ± lift flap and irrigate
    PRK
      stromal haze // use MMC
      sterile infiltrates
      epi defects
      LSCD
    refractive error
    ectasia
    infectious keratitis
      COMMON: POD 3 onset
        2/3 of cases in the first week
        1/3 of cases 7+ days out
      risk factors
        blepharitis
        intraoperative complications
          buttonhole
          free cap
        health care worker
      bugs
        gram positives
        MRSA
        atypical mycobacteria
          chelonae
        fungi
      if you suspect infectious keratitis
        culture stromal component in OT after carefully lifting flap
        empiric therapy == fortified vanc + tobra
          ± lift flap and irrigate with vanc + tobra
        late onset cases
          vanc + amikacin
            for M. chelonae
    PISK
      check IOP
      usually steroid response
      COMMON: POD 10-14 onset
    dry eye
    unhappy patient
      glare
      halos
