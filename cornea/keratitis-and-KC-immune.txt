  PUK
    true PUK is autoimmune by definition
      criteria for PUK
        infectious causes have been ruled out
        true ulceration with loss of epithelium
        true infiltration with WBC
      if there is progressive thinning in a patient with systemic disease
        assume the systemic disease is not controlled
          even if the patient has no symptoms

          the 1˚ treatment of PUK is systemic
          topical steroids are just an adjunct
      reconstructive keratoplasty
        only once the underlying disease is well controlled
        or emergently for perforation with flat chamber
        cyanoacrylate for small holes or to temporise
        lamellar keratoplasty is definitive
          mark the region and cut a template from plastic sheeting
          cut the outline partial thickness
            an adjustable-depth LRI diamond knife is great if available
            15˚ blade can be used as well
            in cases where a round button is suitable the trephine is an option
          lamellar dissection with an angled crescent blade
            to remove diseased tissue and prepare the host bed
          reform the chamber with OVD
          if possible close posterior cornea with interrupted 10-0 nylon
          lamellar dissection of the donor on an artificial AC
          mark and cut donor to fit
          suture in place with 10-0 nylon
            may need to trim flush once partially sutured
      if the entire workup is negative
        could be a true idiopathic Mooren ulcer
          topical steroids
          conjunctival resection
            2 CH either side of the ulcer

            oral prednisone
            patching
            cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg/day
              fall in WBC is the best indicator of immunosuppression
            methotrexate 7.5-15 mg weekly
            azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day
          reconstructive keratoplasty
