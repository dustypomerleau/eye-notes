acid and alkali burns

    goals
        treat pain
        restore clear cornea
        restore ocular surface
            conjunctival goblet cells
            limbal stem cells
        prevent glaucoma
        prevent bacterial superinfection

    acid burns
        usually a chemical with pH 4-
        coagulation of denatured corneal proteins limits penetration
        ground glass appearance

    alkali burns
        sodium hydroxide (lye)
            drain cleaners
        ammonia
        calcium hydroxide (lime)
            cement
            plaster
        rapid penetration of AC
            lipophilic
            denature collagen
            direct damage to TM after penetration
            strongly activate proteolytic enzymes
                MMPs
                NEVER: use NSAIDs in a melting cornea

    severity (grade)
        Roper-Hall (1965) // for exam purposes, this is the most recognized
            1
                epi defect only
            2
                corneal haze
                visible iris
                ± 4- CH focal limbal ischemia
            3
                total epi defect
                corneal haze obscuring iris
                4–6 CH limbal ischemia
            4
                opaque cornea
                6+ CH limbal ischemia
            limbal ischemia is the easiest aspect of grading
                none
                4-
                6-
                6+
            if you can't see the iris the grade is Roper-Hall 3+
        Dua (2001) // my preferred system given better modern era prognostic value
            document as
                CH limbal involvement / % bulbar conj involvement (limbus to fornix)
                limbal involvement
                    limbal ischemia OR complete loss of limbal epithelium including LSC
            grade 4+ have worse outcomes
                conveniently that's when 1/2 of the limbus and conj are involved
            0 CH / 0% (1)
            1+ CH / 1+% (2)
            3+ CH / 30+% (3)
            6+ CH / 50+% (4)
            9+ CH / 75+% (5)
            12 CH / 100% (6)

    treatment
        irrigate with saline to pH 7.0–7.2
        confirm pH 30 minutes later to ensure no hidden particles
        sweep fornices and evert lids
        check pH of the fellow eye to ensure no involvement
        total epi defect may not stain dramatically with fluorescein
        evaluate initial IOP
        meds
            PF lubricants
            cycloplegia
                homatropine 2% tds
            PF Chlorsig minims qid
            FML up to q 1 hour depending on severity
                has collagenase activity
                try to taper rapidly after a week to allow new collagen synthesis
            ALWAYS: use collagenase inhibitors to inhibit MMPs
                doxycycline 100 mg po bd
                ascorbic acid 500 mg po qid
                ascorbic acid 10% drops q 2 hours
            sodium citrate 10% drops q 2 hours
                chelates Ca
                inhibits neutrophils
            oral pain medication
        Follow every 1–2 days.
            monitor
                IOP
                epi defect
                perforation
                superinfection
                symblepharon
        If not completely epithelialized in 2 weeks
            tarsorrhaphy OR
            cover the cornea in amniotic membrane
                limbal purse-string suture
        late options
            limbal stem cell autograft
            limbal stem cell allograft for bilateral cases
            corneal transplant (high failure rate)
            keratoprosthesis // USA
