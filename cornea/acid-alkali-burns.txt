acid and alkali burns

  goals
    treat pain
    restore clear cornea
    restore ocular surface
      conjunctival goblet cells
      limbal stem cells
    prevent glaucoma
    prevent bacterial superinfection

  acid burns
    usually a chemical with pH 4-
    coagulation of denatured corneal proteins limits penetration
    ground glass appearance

  alkali burns
    sodium hydroxide (lye)
      drain cleaners
    ammonia
    calcium hydroxide (lime)
      cement
      plaster
    rapid penetration of AC
      lipophilic
      denature collagen
      strongly activate proteolytic enzymes
        MMPs
        NEVER: use NSAIDs in a melting cornea
      direct damage to TM after penetration

  severity (grade)

    Roper-Hall (1965) // this is what they use in AU so say this on RACE
      1
        epi defect only
      2
        corneal haze
        visible iris
        ± 4- CH focal limbal ischemia
      3
        total epi defect
        corneal haze obscuring iris
        4-6 CH limbal ischemia
      4
        opaque cornea
        6+ CH limbal ischemia
      limbal ischemia is the easiest aspect of grading
        none
        4-
        6-
        6+
      if you can't see the iris it's 3+

=begin
but for your personal reference
    Dua (2001) // my preferred system given better modern era prognostic value
      document as
        CH limbal involvement / % bulbar conj involvement (limbus to fornix)
        limbal involvement
          limbal ischemia OR complete loss of limbal epithelium including LSC
      grade 4+ have worse outcomes
        conveniently that's when 1/2 of the limbus and conj are involved
      0 CH / 0% (1)
      1+ CH / 1+% (2)
      3+ CH / 30+% (3)
      6+ CH / 50+% (4)
      9+ CH / 75+% (5)
      12 CH / 100% (6)

  treatment
    irrigate with saline to pH 7.0-7.2
    confirm pH 30 minutes later to ensure no hidden particles
    sweep fornices and evert lids
    check pH of the fellow eye to ensure no involvement
    total epi defect may not stain dramatically with fluorescein
    evaluate initial IOP
    meds
      PF lubricants
      cycloplegia
        homatropine 2% tds
      PF Chlorsig minims qid
      FML up to q 1/24 depending on severity
        has collagenase activity
        try to taper rapidly after a week to allow new collagen synthesis
      ALWAYS: use collagenase inhibitors to inhibit MMPs
        doxycycline 100 mg po bd
        ascorbic acid 500 mg po qid
        ascorbic acid 10% drops q 2/24
      sodium citrate 10% drops q 2/24
        chelates Ca
        inhibits neutrophils
      oral pain medication
    Follow every 1-2 days.
      monitor
        IOP
        epi defect
        perforation
        superinfection
        symblepharon
    If not completely epithelialised in 2 weeks
      cover the cornea in amniotic membrane
        limbal purse-string suture
      probably say tarsorrhaphy because you haven't done the amnio
    late options
      limbal stem cell autograft
      limbal stem cell allograft for bilateral cases
      corneal transplant (high failure rate)
      keratoprosthesis
        not used in AU
