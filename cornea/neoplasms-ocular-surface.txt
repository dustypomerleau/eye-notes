ocular surface neoplasia

    OSSN
        risk factors
            immunosuppression
                HIV
                    COMMON: under 50
            HPV
                also causes benign papillomas
                if benign papillomas are recurrent after excision
                    heavy cryo
            age
            sun exposure
            smoking
            petrochemicals
            arsenic
                soldering
        no FH BHID
            Native Americans
                Haliwa-Saponi ancestry
                North Carolina
            observe
                fulminant recurrence after excision
        gelatinous
        feeder vessels
        ALWAYS: do impression cytology if you suspect OSSN
            does not show depth
            confirms dysplasia
            won't tell if you if it's invasive
        biopsy
            overall practice pattern in AU
                favors direct excision over incisional biopsy
            large lesions 4+ CH
                incisional biopsy if unsure OR
                straight to chemoreduction + excision if fairly certain
            small lesions
                chemoreduction without biopsy
                excisional biopsy
        preinvasive
            MMC OR 5FU OR interferon alpha 2b
                COMMON: MMC 0.04% qid
                interferon alone requires a long course
                    6–12 months
                chemoreduction very toxic
                    may need 1 week on 1 week off
                    risks
                        LSCD
                        RARELY: punctal stenosis
                follow monthly for regression
        invasive
            ± MMC OR 5FU OR interferon alpha 2b chemoreduction
                practice varies here
                options
                    chemoreduction only
                        small lesions might just melt away
                    excision only
                        small lesions
                    chemoreduction + excision
                        large lesions
                        4+ CH chemoreduction is very important
                            risk of LSCD if you excise with margins
                            probably outweighs risk of LSCD from chemoreduction itself
            excision
                3 mm margins
                    some say 4 mm
                no touch dry technique
                alcohol may help wth corneal epithelium
                beaver blade
                lamellar dissection of involved corneal or scleral bed
                    avoid penetrating the Bowman layer
                        forms a natural barrier
            cryo to bed
                double freeze-thaw
            if primary closure not possible
                amniotic membrane graft
            ±
                MMC OR 5FU OR interferon alpha 2b postoperatively
            ongoing biopsies all 4 quads
                twice a year initially
                50+% recur
            treating LSCD
                autograft
                    once host eye no longer inflamed
                allografts from cadaveric donors do poorly
                    still sometimes necessary
                    e.g. aniridia
                        both eyes affected
                        autograft not an option

    conjunctival melanoma
        BAM in blacks, not so concerning
        unilateral PAM in whites is concerning
        if melanoma - mortality 25%
        DFE to ensure it's not a choroidal breakthrough
        treatment similar to OSSN but:
            always biopsy first
            interferon doesn't work
            adjunctive radiation with a plaque may be needed after excision
            patient needs metastatic workup
                evaluation of regional lymph nodes

    oncocytoma
        reddish-brown nodule on the caruncle
        slow-growing tumor of the accessory lacrimal glands

    conjunctival lymphoma
        biopsy
        flow cytometry
        EBRT
        ± chemo if systemic

    pterygium
        isle de Fuchs are pathognomonic
            can calcify
        indications for surgery
            abutting or occluding visual axis
            approaching visual axis with documented growth
            induction of visually significant astigmatism
            premalignant changes
                CIN
                keratinization
        surgical technique
            conj autograft
                recommended
                    reduces recurrence to 1/10
                sutures OR fibrin glue
            bare sclera
                1/2 will recur
                not acceptable
            beta radiation
                not recommended
                    SINS
                    superinfection
                        COMMON: Pseudomonas
            adjunctive MMC
                MMC drops 0.02% bd x 5 days postop
                not commonly used
                    scleral necrosis
                    superinfection
            postop steroids
                taper slowly
                usually 3 months total

    conjunctival squamous papilloma
        observation
        excision
        chemoreduction
            MMC
            interferon alpha 2b
