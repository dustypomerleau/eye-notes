ocular surface neoplasia

  OSSN
    risk factors
      immunosuppression
        HIV
          COMMON: under 50
      HPV
        also causes benign papillomas
        if benign papillomas are recurrent after excision
          heavy cryo
      age
      sun exposure
      smoking
      petrochemicals
      arsenic
        soldering
    no FH BHID
    gelatinous
    feeder vessels
    ALWAYS: do impression cytology if you suspect OSSN
      does not show depth
      confirms dysplasia
      won't tell if you if it's invasive
    biopsy
      overall practice pattern in AU
        favors direct excision over incisional biopsy
      large lesions 4+ CH
        incisional biopsy if unsure OR
        straight to chemoreduction + excision if fairly certain
      small lesions
        chemoreduction without biopsy
        excisional biopsy
    preinvasive
      MMC OR 5FU OR interferon alpha 2b
        COMMON: MMC 0.04% qid
        interferon alone requires a long course
          6-12 months
        chemoreduction very toxic
          may need 1 week on 1 week off
          risks
            LSCD
            RARELY: punctal stenosis
        follow monthly for regression
    invasive
      ± MMC OR 5FU OR interferon alpha 2b chemoreduction
        practice varies here
        options
          chemoreduction only
            small lesions might just melt away
          excision only
            small lesions
          chemoreduction + excision
            large lesions
            4+ CH chemoreduction is very important
              risk of LSCD if you excise with margins
              probably outweighs risk of LSCD from chemoreduction itself
      excision
        3 mm margins
          some say 4 mm
        no touch dry technique
        alcohol may help wth corneal epithelium
        beaver blade
        lamellar dissection of involved corneal OR scleral bed
          avoid penetrating the Bowman layer
            forms a natural barrier
      cryo to bed
        double freeze-thaw
      if primary closure not possible
        amniotic membrane graft
      ±
        MMC OR 5FU OR interferon alpha 2b postoperatively
      ongoing biopsies all 4 quads
        twice a year initially
        50+% recur
      treating LSCD
        autograft
          once host eye no longer inflamed
        allografts from cadaveric donors do poorly
          still sometimes necessary
          e.g. aniridia
            both eyes affected
            autograft not an option

  conjunctival melanoma
    BAM in blacks, not so concerning
    unilateral PAM in whites is concerning
    if melanoma - mortality 25%
    DFE to ensure it's not a choroidal breakthrough
    treatment similar to OSSN but:
      always biopsy first
      interferon doesn't work
      adjunctive radiation with a plaque may be needed after excision
      patient needs metastatic workup
        evaluation of regional lymph nodes

  oncocytoma
    reddish-brown nodule on the caruncle
    slow-growing tumor of the accessory lacrimal glands

  conjunctival lymphoma
    biopsy
    flow cytometry
    EBRT
    ± chemo if systemic

  pterygium
    isle de Fuchs are pathognomonic
      can calcify
    indications for surgery
      abutting OR occluding visual axis
      approaching visual axis with documented growth
      induction of visually significant astigmatism
      premalignant changes
        CIN
        keratinization
    surgical technique
      conj autograft
        recommended
          reduces recurrence to 1/10
        sutures OR fibrin glue
      bare sclera
        1/2 will recur
        not acceptable
      beta radiation
        not recommended
          SINS
          superinfection
            COMMON: Pseudomonas
      adjunctive MMC
        MMC drops 0.02% bd x 5 days postop
        not commonly used
          scleral necrosis
          superinfection
      postop steroids
        taper slowly
        usually 3 months total

  conjunctival squamous papilloma
    observation
    excision
    chemoreduction
      MMC
      interferon alpha 2b
