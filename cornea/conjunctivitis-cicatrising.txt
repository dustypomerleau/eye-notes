treatment

  SJS, MMP, and GVHD all start with:
    PF lubricants
      say Cellufresh
        sounds Australian
    antibiotic prophylaxis
    ± punctal occlusion
    topical cyclosporine A
    scleral CTL to maintain the fornix
    // don't lyse symblephara during active inflammation

    SJS
      ADMIT to a burn unit
      stop the offending agent
      systemic prednisone
      IVIG
      COMMON: amniotic membrane
        trim eyelashes
        create a custom symblepharon ring out of IV tubing
        cover with amniotic membrane
          ocular surface
          fornices
          meibomian glands
          external eyelids
        suture the AM to the eyelids

    MMP
      key findings
        inferior symblepharon
        inferior fornicial shortening
        keratinised caruncle
      ALSO:
        trichiasis
        entropion
        punctal stenosis
        subepithelial fibrosis
        keratinised cornea and conjunctiva
      older woman
      inferior fornix 8- mm
      subepithelial fibrosis over the tarsus
      oral mucosal lesions
        ulcers
        angular stomatitis
      systemic symptoms
        laryngeal strictures
          can be life threatening
          ask about difficulty breathing
          ALWAYS: consult ENT
        esophageal strictures
          ask about dysphagia
        GI symptoms
          constipation
          melena
          rectal bleeding
        any mucous membrane can be affected
          anus
          vagina
          urethra
      conjunctival biopsy
        bulbar conj
          to avoid promoting symblepharon formation
        in a quiet area
        staining for anti-basement-membrane Ab
        high false negative rate
      skin biopsy
        send salt-split skin for direct immunofluorescence
        normal appearing perilesional skin is best
      serum assay
        serum can be sent for indirect immunofluorescence
        confirms circulating anti-basement-membrane Ab
        uses healthy salt-split skin as a substrate
      dapsone
        good for the slow simmering disease
        titrate upward from 25 mg po daily
        adjust weekly
        usually quiets at 100-150 mg po daily
        then taper over several months
        follow FBC
          can cause hemolytic anemia
          avoid in G6PD deficiency
      if more acute or aggressive
        per Jabs
          rituximab
            newer
          cyclophosphamide
            classic
        per my previous reading
          prednisolone 1 mg/kg/d to achieve short-term control
          cyclosporine
          cyclophosphamide
          MTX
          mycophenolate
      recalcitrant cases
        rituximab
        infliximab
      may need late surgery
        usually for entropion

    GVHD
      cyclosporine
      tacrolimus
      topical steroids
        high risk at home
          immunosuppressed

  surgery
    don't do any surgery during active inflammation
    lids first
      later
        amniotic membrane grafting
        forniceal reconstruction
    avoid corneal surgery unless there is excessive thinning or perforation
      high failure rates
    tarsal fracture with everting sutures
    tarsoconjunctival or mucosal grafts
      ear cartilage
      sclera
      hard palate
