treatment

    SJS, MMP, and GVHD all start with:
        PF lubricants
        antibiotic prophylaxis
        ± punctal occlusion
        topical cyclosporine A
        scleral CTL to maintain the fornix
        // don't lyse symblephara during active inflammation

        SJS
            start as described in treatment section header +
            ADMIT to a burn unit
            stop the offending agent
            systemic prednisone
            IVIG
            COMMON: amniotic membrane
                trim eyelashes
                create a custom symblepharon ring out of IV tubing
                cover with amniotic membrane
                    ocular surface
                    fornices
                    meibomian glands

                high false negative rate
            skin biopsy

                normal appearing perilesional skin is best
            serum assay
                serum can be sent for indirect immunofluorescence
                confirms circulating anti-basement-membrane Ab
                uses healthy salt-split skin as a substrate
            start as described in treatment section header +
            dapsone
                good for the slow simmering disease
                titrate upward from 25 mg po daily
                adjust weekly
                usually quiets at 100–150 mg po daily
                then taper over several months
                follow FBC
                    can cause hemolytic anemia
