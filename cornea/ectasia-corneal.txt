  KCN
    // rule out pellucid (lobster claw topography) before diagnosing KCN
    mean clinical onset 40s
      often starts subclinically around puberty
      tends to stabilise by 50s
    usually sporadic
      some genetic predisposition
      lots of potential loci
      combo of genes + environment
      1st degree relatives of probands are at slightly higher risk
    high prevalence in myopes seeking refractive surgery
      be on the lookout
      5+% in most series
        including form fruste can be 15+%
      warning signs
        unstable refraction
          ask for historical refractions
        reduced vision even with glasses
        myopia 10+ D
        astigmatism 2+ D
          oblique astigmatism is highly associated with KCN
    oil droplet red reflex
    scissoring on retinoscopy
    look for concurrent atopic disease
      blepharitis
    Munson sign
    Rizzuti sign
      penlight directed at temporal limbus
      bright reflection from the nasal limbus
    Fleischer iron ring
      hemosiderin deposit in the basal epithelium
      partial or complete ring
      base of the cone
      stands out under cobalt blue light
    prominent corneal nerves
    Vogt striae stromal folds
      deep
      vertical
      disappear with gentle digital pressure
    Descemet rupture with hydrops
      acute hydrops
        vision drops
        painful
        low IOP
        look for the Descemet tears
        treatment
          Chlorsig
          cycloplegia
          hypertonic saline 5%
          if inflamed
            mild steroid
          heals with scarring
            1-2/12
    central K 47+ D on topo
      apical cone
      inferior paracentral thinning
        under 500 µm is usually pathologic
      irregular astigmatism
      posterior corneal surface is more sensitive for KCN
        normal
          5- µm posterior elevation (toric ellipsoid)
        KCN
          10+ µm posterior elevation (toric ellipsoid)
      approach topography systematically
        3 strikes
          steep area 47+ D
          thinnest pachymetry 500- µm
          posterior elevation (toric ellipsoid) 10+ µm
          pentacam posterior float 40+ µm definitely concerning
        posterior surface changes in KCN
          greater than anterior changes
          happen earlier than anterior changes
        look for skewed axes
          bowtie not orthogonal
        take age into account
          a 20 YO is more concerning than a 50 YO with equivalent findings
        asymmetry between the eyes makes subtle changes more suspicious
    associations
      atopic disease
        asthma
        eczema
        vernal KC
        atopic KC
      Down syndrome
        might be related to eye rubbing
      OSA
      BROADLY: connective tissue disorders
        AD OR sporadic Marfan
        osteogenesis imperfecta
      aniridia
      RP
      rubella
      LHON

    treatment
    avoid eye rubbing
    serial MRx and topography
      helps confirm progression
    rigid CTL
      will treat 90% of patients
        easiest on nipple shape
        hardest on globus shape
        in practice
          60+ D is very difficult to fit
          but ALWAYS: mention CTL fitting in KCN
      surgery only if CTL fails in experienced hands
    intrastromal ring segments
      brands
        KERARING in AU
        INTACS in USA
      only if CCT is 400+ µm
      not a popular option
        infection
          Strep.
            viridans
            mitis
            pneumococcus
          Staph.
            aureus
            epidermidis
          Pseudomonas
          Nocardia
          Klebsiella
          Clostridium
          Paecilomyces
          Aspergillus
        extrusion
        epithelial ingrowth
    crosslinking
      use for progressive disease
        not at presentation
        document progression for at least a year
          1+ D steepening
          1+ D increase in astigmatism
          20+ µm thinning of pachymetry
          1+ line drop in BCVA
        best candidates are 400+ µm at thinnest point
          risk of endothelial failure with 400- µm thickness
      links between tyrosines on collagen fibrils
      tyrosine is oxidised to dityrosine
      UVA causes the oxidation
      riboflavin potentiates the effect of UVA
      avoid crosslinking
        cornea 400- µm
        pregnant or breastfeeding
        history of other corneal disease
          especially HSV keratitis
        riboflavin allergy
      consent
        won't improve vision
          vision might be briefly worse
        failure to prevent progression
        2˚ infection
        stromal haze
        persistent epi defect
        pain to be expected
      Dresden (2008) protocol used in AU
        epi off using alcohol
        (0.1% riboflavin + 20% dextran) x 30 minutes

        BCTL until epithelialised
        Chlorsig + FML qid
        exams at (1, 3, 7, 30)/7
    DALK
      only if no history of hydrops
      pros
        low risk of rejection
      cons
        technically difficult in KCN
    PK
      may have slightly better VA outcomes
    Bowman layer transplant into a manually dissected midstromal pocket
      new and not widespread

  Pentacam
    rotating Scheimpflug images using a common centrepoint for registration
    anterior and posterior surfaces measured
    common registration point
      better at locating the posterior corneal surface
      more accurately measures thickness
    tomography only
      "topography" is generated
      less sensitive to topographic contours than a placido system
      Galilei is better - it has Placido topography + Scheimpflug tomography
  Orbscan
    horizontal slit-beam images of the anterior and posterior cornea
    combined with Placido-based topography of the anterior cornea
    often mislocates the posterior corneal surface
      usually too far forward
        underestimates thickness
  Galilei
    dual rotating Scheimpflug images + Placido disk
      Placido provides good curvature matching
      Scheimpflug provides good posterior surface
    motion correction using the iris pattern as a reference
    dual Scheimpflug allows accurate pachymetry even after motion correction
    provides the best corneal power estimation for CEIOL

cataract surgery in corneal ectasia
  if the view is clear
    usually do CEIOL alone to start
    COMMON: 45 D standard Ks
  if the patient is looking at a future PK OR DALK
    55- use patients Ks with target of low myopia (Moorfields)
    55+ use standard Ks
      Moorfields standard Ks
        43.25
      Irving Raber standard Ks (Wills)
        45-47
        you have some control when you do the graft
          oversize 0.25 mm for 45
          oversize 0.5 mm for 47
    if the ectasia is off-centre
      ALSO: central 2-3 mm of IOLMaster OR Lenstar Ks
  toric IOL
    should not be your default
      requires stable refraction
      confirm over multiple visits
    very difficult to fit a rigid CTL over a toric IOL
