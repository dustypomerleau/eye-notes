  ALWAYS: scrape even if intact epithelium
    e.g. infectious crystalline keratopathy
    always establish the diagnosis

    HSV OR VZV
      epithelial keratitis
        dendritic
          NEVER put steroids on a dendrite
          zoster dendrites
            stain less
            blunt ends instead of bulbs
          50+% will have a second event over 5+ years

          nummular stromal keratitis
            more likely HSV
        disciform keratitis
          mostly endotheliitis
          stromal edema is 2˚

            topical steroids reduce the duration of inflammation
              q 2 hours
              taper weekly based on response
            oral aciclovir 400 bd cuts recurrence in half
              cost of Valtrex 500 daily ~= aciclovir 400 bd in AU
              if kidney function is poor
                avoid long term aciclovir OR Valtrex
        stromal scarring
          must be quiet 6 months before considering PK
          continue oral aciclovir to prevent infection of the graft
        use preoperative antivirals before CEIOL OR PK
          aciclovir 800 mg bd 3 days before
          valaciclovir 500 mg bd 2 days before
          famcyclovir 250 bd 2 days before
          when to stop?
            1 weeks to 1 year depending on the severity/number of previous events

          intact epithelium
            ALWAYS: scrape anyway
          prior corneal surgery
          chronic steroid use
            need to balance steroids and antibiotics
            risk of worsening infection + risk of rejection
            adjust steroids depending on which aspect concerns you more
          treatment
            aggressive topical antibiotics
              3rd or 4th generation quinolone OR
              fortified cefazolin 50 mg/mL OR
              fortified vancomycin 50 mg/mL

    amphotericin B
      Aspergillus
      Candida
    natamycin
      fusarium

      bad empiric therapy
        many fungi are resistant
      good therapy when sensitivities are known

  protozoa
    Acanthamoeba
      CTL wearers
        even more hygiene-related than bacterial keratitis
        biggest risk factor is overnight wear
      swimming pool OR hot tub
      nonsuppurative
      clinical findings
        epitheliopathy that stains with rose bengal
          PEE

        ring infiltrate
          classic presentation
          late disease
            usually not in the first 4 weeks after onset
          only 1/5 really have a ring
      testing
        Giemsa
        PAS
        non-nutrient agar with E. coli overlay
          hard to culture
        PCR if available
        confocal microscopy
          cysts are visible
        corneal biopsy
          if the patient is not responding to therapy
          take epithelium and anterior stroma
          3 mm site is standard
      do not confuse with HSV
        more painful
        infiltrates are multifocal
      treatment
        biguanides
          chlorhexidine 0.02%
          PHMB 0.02%
          trophozoites are the active infection but you need to kill the cysts
        diamidines
          propamidine AKA Brolene 0.1%
            toxic to the epithelium
            not used first line
            not used as monotherapy
          hexamidine 0.1%
        minimum of 2 weeks biguanide therapy before considering topical steroids
        4th gen. quinolone
          prophylaxis
          they probably use oflox in AU
        PK OR DALK
          only if quiet for 6 months

  treatment
    viral swab for PCR
    scrape & culture for superinfection
    stop topical medications with preservatives
      for HSV OR VZV ulcers with a neurotrophic component
        use oral valaciclovir OR aciclovir rather than aciclovir ointment
    PF lubricants
    bandage CTL
      use with caution
      usually requires antibiotic prophylaxis
      preservatives could delay healing
    autologous serum drops
    address any ectropion
      LTS for very lax LL
    BOTOX-induced therapeutic ptosis
    temporary OR permanent tarsorrhaphy
    amniotic membrane graft
    Gunderson conjunctival flap
  if the eye perforates
    glue with cyanoacrylate in the OT
      gives you much more control than gluing in clinic
    if the perforation is large enough to collapse the AC
      poor prognosis
      urgent PK is sometimes required
      innervation is still poor after a transplant
      may need to add partial tarsorrhaphy over the PK
