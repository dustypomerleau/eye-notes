infectious keratitis

for exam purposes
    ALWAYS: scrape even if intact epithelium
        e.g. infectious crystalline keratopathy
        always establish the diagnosis

    some cases may be treated presumptively under close monitoring
    e.g. CTL-associated infectious keratitis with a tiny ED

        if the perforation is large enough to collapse the AC
            poor prognosis
            urgent PK is sometimes required
            innervation is still poor after a transplant
            may need to add partial tarsorrhaphy over the PK
